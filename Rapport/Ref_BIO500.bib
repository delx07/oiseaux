The chickadee vocalizations were played at abandoned chickadee nests, and the numbers and species of other birds that approached the speaker were tallied. Few non-chickadees were observed in the area when the song was played. That significantly more birds approached the speaker and displayed mobbing behavior during the mobbing call playback suggests that black-capped chickadee mobbing vocalizations carry meaning for at least ten other avian species. This finding supports the idea that species subjected to the same predators in an area may benefit by recognizing each others’ predator calls. This recognition may be facilitated by the similar structure of different species’ mobbing calls and also a learned association of another species’ call with the presence of a predator.},

We present a time-efficient method to estimate the relative reproductive activity of the forest songbird community. A recording of mobbing calls of Black-capped Chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) was broadcast at pre-selected stations during the breeding season. These calls attracted individuals of many bird species present in the vicinity, allowing visual detection of reproductive activity (e.g., adults carrying food or presumed pairs). In mature deciduous forests of northern New Brunswick, 50 bird species responded to the playbacks. Playbacks significantly increased the probability of visual observations of birds compared to silent observations conducted before broadcasting mobbing calls. In coniferous forests of central Québec, playbacks attracted 24 species and also provided a significantly greater opportunity to make visual observations of individual birds. In New Brunswick, mobbing playbacks facilitated more observations of reproductive evidence relative to point counts. Observation periods were brief and a 306-ha plot (1.75 × 1.75 km, 64 points spaced 250 m apart) could be surveyed by foot in less than 32 observer-hours. The proportion of individuals of a given species showing evidence of reproductive activity was used as an index of reproductive success. Black-throated Blue Warblers (Dendroica caerulescens) and Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) had a reproductive index consistent with their true nesting success as derived from intensive nest monitoring on the same plots.},

Methods of increasing the power of proposed research that do not involve merely increasing sample size (such as reduction in measurement error, increasing ‘dose’ of the independent variable and optimizing the design) are noted.

	abstract = {Living species of Cephalopoda are classified into two main lineages, Nautiloidea and Coleoidea. Within the latter, two main groups are distinguished, Octopodiformes and Decapodiformes. Phylogenetic relationships within Coleoidea have been the subject of numerous studies and the relative phylogenetic position of several enigmatic groups, such as Vampyromorpha, Idiosepioidea and Spirulida, among others, has been contentious. Here, we reconstruct the phylogeny of Cephalopoda using all (39) currently reported complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes; in addition, we concatenated available partial mt genes from five important lineages (represented by genera Opisthoteuthis, Argonauta, Japetella, Thaumeledone and Spirula) that lack complete mt genomes, in order to include them in the phylogenetic analyses. The reconstructed trees recovered the monophyly of Octopodiformes (Octopoda + Vampyromorpha), of Octopoda and of Decapodiformes. Within Octopoda, the first split was between Cirrata and Incirrata and, within the latter, between Argonautoidea and Octopodoidea. Within Octopodoidea, the family Octopodidae, as traditionally defined, was nonmonophyletic. Within Decapodiformes, Sepiida were recovered sister to a clade including Idiosepiida as the first-diverging lineage. Among the remaining lineages of this clade, Myopsina were recovered sister to a ‘pelagic’ clade including Bathyteuthoidea, Spirulida and Oegopsida, to the exclusion of Sepiolida. Based on this fully resolved phylogeny, we inferred the evolution of gene rearrangements among the studied mitochondrial genomes, following a tandem duplication and random loss model. Finally, a chronogram was estimated under an uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock, which gave estimates of dates of major cladogenetic events within Cephalopoda that were considerably younger than those in previous studies.},

Despite the excellent fossil record of cephalopods, their early evolution is poorly understood. Different, partly incompatible phylogenetic hypotheses have been proposed in the past, which reflected individual author’s opinions on the importance of certain characters but were not based on thorough cladistic analyses. At the same time, methods of phylogenetic inference have undergone substantial improvements. For fossil datasets, which typically only include morphological data, Bayesian inference and in particular the introduction of the fossilized birth-death model have opened new possibilities. Nevertheless, many tree topologies recovered from these new methods reflect large uncertainties, which have led to discussions on how to best summarize the information contained in the posterior set of trees.

Results
We present a large, newly compiled morphological character matrix of Cambrian and Ordovician cephalopods to conduct a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis and resolve existing controversies. Our results recover three major monophyletic groups, which correspond to the previously recognized Endoceratoidea, Multiceratoidea, and Orthoceratoidea, though comprising slightly different taxa. In addition, many Cambrian and Early Ordovician representatives of the Ellesmerocerida and Plectronocerida were recovered near the root. The Ellesmerocerida is para- and polyphyletic, with some of its members recovered among the Multiceratoidea and early Endoceratoidea. These relationships are robust against modifications of the dataset. While our trees initially seem to reflect large uncertainties, these are mainly a consequence of the way clade support is measured. We show that clade posterior probabilities and tree similarity metrics often underestimate congruence between trees, especially if wildcard taxa are involved.

Conclusions
Our results provide important insights into the earliest evolution of cephalopods and clarify evolutionary pathways. We provide a classification scheme that is based on a robust phylogenetic analysis. Moreover, we provide some general insights on the application of Bayesian phylogenetic inference on morphological datasets. We support earlier findings that quartet similarity metrics should be preferred over the Robinson-Foulds distance when higher-level phylogenetic relationships are of interest and propose that using a posteriori pruned maximum clade credibility trees help in assessing support for phylogenetic relationships among a set of relevant taxa, because they provide clade support values that better reflect the phylogenetic signal.

	abstract = {Cephalopods are extraordinary molluscs equipped with vertebrate-like intelligence and a unique buoyancy system for locomotion. A growing body of evidence from the fossil record, embryology and Bayesian molecular divergence estimations provides a comprehensive picture of their origins and evolution. Cephalopods evolved during the Cambrian (∼530 Ma) from a monoplacophoran-like mollusc in which the conical, external shell was modified into a chambered buoyancy apparatus. During the mid-Palaeozoic (∼416 Ma) cephalopods diverged into nautiloids and the presently dominant coleoids. Coleoids (i.e. squids, cuttlefish and octopods) internalised their shells and, in the late Palaeozoic (∼276 Ma), diverged into Vampyropoda and the Decabrachia. This shell internalisation appears to be a unique evolutionary event. In contrast, the loss of a mineralised shell has occurred several times in distinct coleoid lineages. The general tendency of shell reduction reflects a trend towards active modes of life and much more complex behaviour.},

	abstract = {High-level classification of the nautiloid cephalopods has been largely neglected since the publication of the Russian and American treatises in the early 1960s. Although there is broad general agreement amongst specialists regarding the status of nautiloid orders, there is no real consensus or consistent approach regarding higher ranks and an array of superorders utilising various morphological features has been proposed. With work now commencing on the revision of the Treatise Part K, there is an urgent need for a methodical and standardised approach to the high-level classification of the nautiloids. The scheme proposed here utilizes the form of muscle attachment scars as a diagnostic feature at subclass level; other features (including siphuncular structures and cameral deposits) are employed at ordinal level. We recognise five subclasses of nautiloid cephalopods (Plectronoceratia, Multiceratia, Tarphyceratia nov., Orthoceratia, Nautilia) and 18 orders including the Order Rioceratida nov. which contains the new family Bactroceratidae. This scheme has the advantage of relative simplicity (it avoids the use of superorders) and presents a balanced approach which reflects the considerable morphological diversity and phylogenetic longevity of the nautiloids in comparison with the ammonoid and coleoid cephalopods. To avoid potential confusion arising in the higher levels of nautiloid classification employed in the revision of the Treatise Part K, we propose herein to replace the suffix ‘-oidea’ at subclass level with the suffix ‘-ia’. Apart from removing ambiguity and clarifying the nomenclature, this approach also brings greater consistency and affinity with modern zoological classification schemes used for cephalopods. The original Treatise Part K adopted an ‘abbreviated’ form of name for nautiloid orders using the ending ‘-cerida’ rather than ‘-ceratida’ (e.g., Order Actinocerida rather than Actinoceratida). For the revision of Treatise Part K, we propose using the ‘full’ version of the ordinal names. This approach re-employs several order names in their original form, e.g., Ellesmeroceratida, Oncoceratida, and Tarphyceratida. For reasons of consistency, we also apply the same to ordinal names created since the original Treatise Part K; therefore, Order Bisonocerida becomes Bisonoceratida.},

These and many other fossils have since been found homes alongside modern invertebrate phyla. Another of Gould's 'weird wonders' was Nectocaris. The few fossils available for study looked like a chordate fused with an arthropod. Now, with ninety new specimens collected by the Royal Ontario Museum to examine, Martin Smith and Jean-Bernard Caron suggest that Nectocaris, too, can be given a place in the order of things. Its anatomy suggests a relationship with cephalopods — a group that includes the octopus, cuttlefish, and extinct ammonites. And with paired camera-type eyes, flexible tentacles and jet propulsion via a 'nozzle', the predatory animal looks rather like a squid but with two rather than eight or ten tentacles.},

Knightoconus, a new genus of the Hypseloconidae (Mollusca: Monoplacophora) from rocks of early Franconian age in Antarctica, is multiseptate. The multiple septa are a criticàl feature to be expected in a form ancestral to cephalopods. Fossil cephalopods, however, invariably have a siphuncle as well as septa; some gastropods, some hyolithids, and some monoplacophorans also have septa but lack a siphuncle. Therefore, only the siphuncle can be considered a unique and particularly significant feature of the cephalopod shell. Hypothetical reconstructions of molluscan anatomy support the notion that cephalopods may have been derived directly from a hypseloconid having a high, slightly curved, multiseptate, bilaterally symmetrical shell, by the subsequent development of a siphuncle.},

Both unweighted and successive weighting maximum-parsimony analyses were undertaken, and the phylogenetic signal of the data was evaluated. Unweighted analyses support the hypothesis of monophyly for Loliginidae, and suggest some well-supported sister species and crown-clade relationships (such as Alloteuthis Wülker and Sepioteuthis Blainville), but the positions of these groups relative to one another cannot be resolved due to the large number of most-parsimonious trees. Successive weighting analyses showed support for some additional major clades (Photololigo Natsukari and Nipponololigo Natsukari), and provided insight into the cladistic information value of the characters in the analysis. Continued collection of morphological and internal anatomical data for these species for all stages of the life cycle, as well as the addition of molecular data to the analysis, could help resolve relationships within the group.},

In our Maximum Likelihood (ML) tree, sepiids (cuttlefish) are at the most basal position of all decapodiformes, and oegopsids and myopsids form a monophyletic clade, thus supporting the traditional classification of the Order Teuthida. We detected extensive gene rearrangements in the mitochondrial genomes of broad cephalopod groups. It is likely that the arrangements of mitochondrial genes in Oegopsida and Sepiida were derived from those of Octopoda, which is thought to be the ancestral order, by entire gene duplication and random gene loss. Oegopsida in particular has undergone long-range gene duplications. We also found that the mitochondrial gene arrangement of Sepioteuthis lessoniana differs from that of Loligo bleekeri, although they belong to the same family. Analysis of both the phylogenetic tree and mitochondrial gene rearrangements of coleoid Cephalopoda suggests that each mitochondrial gene arrangement was acquired after the divergence of each lineage.},

The resultant cladogram (177 equally parsimonious trees at 191 steps, CI 0.429) resolved all relationships except those among the 16 exemplars of the Octopodidae included and those among Tremoctopus, Ocythoe and Argonauta. Bootstrap values of over 90\% support the monophyly of the finned and finless octopods, relationships among the finned octopods, the bolitaenids and the monophyly of Haliphron, Tremoctopus, Ocythoe and Argonauta; bootstrap values for other nodes range from 57 to 79\%. Among finned octopods, specimens representing Grimpoteuthis are basal, as Voss (1988a) suggested. Specimens of Opisthoteuthis represent a distinct lineage, and are sister taxon, in this analysis, of Cirroteuthis (although specimens of Stauroteuthis could not be included). New definitions of the genera Opisthoteuthis and Grimpoteuthis are provided to reflect their separate evolutionary histories rather than their overt morphological similarity. Among finless octopods, bolitaenids are basal. The monophyletic Octopodidae is the sister taxon to the clade containing the sister taxa Vitreledonella and Amphitretus, and Haliphron, Tremoctopus, Ocythoe and Argonauta. The Ctenoglossa and Heteroglossa, families grouped by shared radular dentition, are diphyletic and paraphyletic, respectively. The cladistic relationships demonstrate that both the Vitrele-donellidae and Idioctopodidae are junior synonyms of the Amphitretidae; despite conspicuous morphological differences separating these taxa, they share a recent evolutionary history.},

	abstract = {Understanding how variation in vital rates interact to shape the trajectories of populations has long been understood to be a critical component of informed management and restoration efforts. However, an expanding body of work suggests that the expectations for population dynamics of ungulates may not be applicable to small, declining, or threatened populations. Populations of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) suffered declines at the turn of the 20th century, and restoration efforts have been mixed such that many populations remain small and isolated. Here, we utilized survey data collected from 1983 to 2018 from 17 populations of bighorn sheep in Montana and Wyoming to estimate the parameters of a stage-specific population model that we used to (1) characterize the spatial and temporal variation in key vital rates including whether populations were stable, increasing, or declining; (2) estimate the contributions of vital rates to variation in population growth rates; and (3) evaluate potential sources of variation in lamb survival. We found substantial variation in all vital rates both among years and populations, strong evidence for an overall decline in nine of the 17 populations, and clear evidence for multiple combinations of vital rates that resulted in positive population trajectories. The contribution of ewe survival and lamb survival to the total variation in population growth rates varied among populations; however, declines in ewe survival dominated transitions of population trajectories from stable or increasing to declining, whereas reversals of declining population trajectories were dominated by improved lamb survival. We found strong evidence for a diverse set of associations between lamb survival and environmental covariates related to growing season and winter severity. The estimated relationships predict that environmental drivers can cause important changes in lamb survival and provide suggestive evidence that the presence of Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae is not sufficient to prevent population growth. Although our work demonstrates that the trajectories of these populations of bighorn sheep are driven by a variety of processes, the diversity of relationships between vital rates and population growth rates also suggests that there are multiple pathways to manage for population recovery.},

We studied two marked populations of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) in Alberta, Canada, to determine if body mass affected the survival of different sex-age classes. Chest girth at weaning was correlated ( P {\textless} 0.0001) with survival of bighorn lambs in the Sheep River population. In the Ram Mountain population, body mass in mid-September had a stronger effect upon survival than mass in early June, mass gain in summer, or mass loss in winter. Body mass at weaning was correlated with lamb survival ( P = 0.004). In both study areas, relationships between size and survival of lambs were similar for the two sexes. At Ram Mountain, survival of yearling and adult males seemed to be independent of body mass. Light yearling females were less likely to survive than heavy yearling females. Among females aged 3 -6 years, body mass had no effect on survival. Among females 7 years of age and older, mass in mid-September had a weak but significant ( P = 0.03) effect on survival. Females were slightly lighter in mid-September in their last year of life than in the rest of their adult life. Maternal expenditure is unlikely to affect the survival of prime-age ewes, but may have a detrimental effect on the survival of older ewes.},

We examined 320 kills and found that ungulates provided {\textgreater}99\% of the biomass consumed by cougars in November–April. All ungulate species found within the study area were taken by cougars. Predation on bighorn sheep varied greatly from year to year; cougars were known to kill 0–13\% of the November sheep population, and 0–57\% of over-winter sheep mortality consisted of known cougar kills. Of 29 bighorns killed by cougars, 13 were lambs. The remainder ranged in age from 1 to 17 years and included 9 ewes and 7 rams. Cougar predation on bighorn sheep appears to be largely an individual, learned behaviour; most cougars rarely killed sheep, but some preyed heavily upon them. One female killed 9\% of the population and 26\% of the lambs over a single winter. For mountain-dwelling ungulates that occur in small groups, the presence of one or a few individual specialist predators may strongly and unpredictably influence demography and behaviour.},

The yearly survival of females aged 2–7 yr was remarkably similar and very high (92–95\%) in all five populations. Survival of adult males varied among species and populations. Survival decreased from 8 yr onward for both sexes in all populations, suggesting that senescence was a common phenomenon. Male survival was lower than female survival, and the gender difference increased with age. The extent of sex differences in survival was related neither to sexual dimorphism in mass nor to the level of polygyny, suggesting that species differences in social behavior, particularly mating system and the level of male–male aggression, may be more important than simply the level of polygyny in explaining sexual differences in survival.

	abstract = {To develop effective management strategies for the recovery of threatened and endangered species, it is critical to identify those vital rates (survival and reproductive parameters) responsible for poor population performance and those whose increase will most efficiently change a population's trajectory. In actual application, however, approaches identifying key vital rates are often limited by inadequate demographic data, by unrealistic assumptions of asymptotic population dynamics, and of equal, infinitesimal changes in mean vital rates. We evaluated the consequences of these limitations in an analysis of vital rates most important in the dynamics of federally endangered Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis sierrae). Based on data collected from 1980 to 2007, we estimated vital rates in three isolated populations, accounting for sampling error, variance, and covariance. We used analytical sensitivity analysis, life-stage simulation analysis, and a novel non-asymptotic simulation approach to (1) identify vital rates that should be targeted for subspecies recovery; (2) assess vital rate patterns of endangered bighorn sheep relative to other ungulate populations; (3) evaluate the performance of asymptotic vs. non-asymptotic models for meeting short-term management objectives; and (4) simulate management scenarios for boosting bighorn sheep population growth rates. We found wide spatial and temporal variation in bighorn sheep vital rates, causing rates to vary in their importance to different populations. As a result, Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep exhibited population-specific dynamics that did not follow theoretical expectations or those observed in other ungulates. Our study suggests that vital rate inferences from large, increasing, or healthy populations may not be applicable to those that are small, declining, or endangered. We also found that, while asymptotic approaches were generally applicable to bighorn sheep conservation planning, our non-asymptotic population models yielded unexpected results of importance to managers. Finally, extreme differences in the dynamics of individual bighorn sheep populations imply that effective management strategies for endangered species recovery may often need to be population-specific.},

Many programs that are identified with the purpose of ‘surveillance’ represent an inefficient use of conservation funds and effort. Here, we revisit the 1964 paper by Platt and argue that his recommendations about the conduct of science are equally relevant to the conduct of ecological monitoring programs. In particular, we argue that monitoring should not be viewed as a stand-alone activity, but instead as a component of a larger process of either conservation-oriented science or management. Corresponding changes in monitoring focus and design would lead to substantial increases in the efficiency and usefulness of monitoring results in conservation.},

	abstract = {Estimating survival and documenting causes and timing of mortality events in neonate bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) improves understanding of population ecology and factors influencing recruitment. During 2010–2012, we captured and radiocollared 74 neonates in the Black Hills, South Dakota, of which 95\% (70) died before 52 weeks of age. Pneumonia (36\%) was the leading cause of mortality followed by predation (30\%). We used known fate analysis in Program MARK to estimate weekly survival rates and investigate the influence of intrinsic variables on 52-week survival. Model \{S1 wk, 2–8 wks, {\textgreater}8 wks\} had the lowest AICc (Akaike’s Information Criterion corrected for small sample size) value, indicating that age (3-stage age-interval: 1 week, 2–8 weeks, and {\textgreater}8 weeks) best explained survival. Weekly survival estimates for 1 week, 2–8 weeks, and {\textgreater}8 weeks were 0.81 (95\% CI = 0.70–0.88), 0.86 (95\% CI = 0.81–0.90), and 0.94 (95\% CI = 0.91–0.96), respectively. Overall probability of surviving 52 weeks was 0.02 (95\% CI = 0.01–0.07). Of 70 documented mortalities, 21\% occurred during the first week, 55\% during weeks 2–8, and 23\% occurred {\textgreater}8 weeks of age. We found pneumonia and predation were temporally heterogeneous with lambs most susceptible to predation during the first 2–3 weeks of life, while the greatest risk from pneumonia occurred from weeks 4–8. Our results indicated pneumonia was the major factor limiting recruitment followed by predation. Mortality from predation may have been partly compensatory to pneumonia and its effects were less pronounced as alternative prey became available. Given the high rates of pneumonia-caused mortality we observed, and the apparent lack of pneumonia-causing pathogens in bighorn populations in the western Black Hills, management activities should be geared towards eliminating contact between diseased and healthy populations.},

The secretions are taken into the mouth and licked on to the spines. In spite of interest in chemical, mechanical and behavioural anti-predator adaptions of both invertebrates and vertebrates1 there have been no reports of the behavioural utilisation of the anti-predator secretions of one species by another for its own defence. Toad skin is one of many irritating substances used by hedgehogs in self-anointing, and the presence of any of these, fresh or dried, on the spines would probably increase the pain or potential of infection to the would-be predator.},

However, rigorous evidence to support these views remains scant, so the legend persists.

	abstract = {1. The effect of mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) predation on the invertebrate community in a hypereutrophic constructed treatment wetland in southern California was investigated at two nutrient levels that influenced sestonic food abundance. 2. Gambusia affinis and insect predators in the wetland had a significant impact on larval mosquito density in the wetland irrespective of nutrient level. At the end of the 5-month study, cladoceran abundance in predator exclusion enclosures was 2–3 orders of magnitude greater than in the treatments that allowed access by planktivores. Chironomids were the most abundant insect group collected in emergence traps, and midge production from the high nutrient location of the wetland was greater than from the low nutrient location, but was not affected significantly by G. affinis. The presence of abundant alternative prey in this highly enriched wetland may have weakened the predation impact of G. affinis on mosquitoes. 3. The abundances of six invertebrate groups in dipper samples and of four insect groups in emergence trap collections were analysed using a multivariate distance-based linear model. Fish treatment and location interactions with sampling date explained significant amounts of the variation in the abundance of invertebrate groups. 4. Multivariate multiple regression analysis showed that chlorophyll-a concentration explained a large portion of the variability in non-predatory insect and zooplankton abundance at the high nutrient location, whereas bacterial density explained a large portion of the variability in the abundances of these taxa at the low nutrient location. Predatory insects were not directly coupled to the bottom-up influence of bacterial abundance and chlorophyll-a.},

The two microcosms were identical with regard to initial chemical composition and biological inocula, with the exceptions that in one microcosm (designated Tank 2) mosquitofish (Gambusia) and herbivorous catfish (Plecostomus) were added. Three distinct communities developed in the tanks, a phytoplankton-zooplankton assemblage and two periphyton-zoobenthos communities associated with the sides and bottom of the tanks, respectively. Community development was monitored closely in the zooplankton-phytoplankton assemblage and to a lesser degree in the other 2 communities. Developmental and successional patterns were similar in both tanks. A major difference between the tanks was timing of succession of the zooplankton and zoobenthos, attributable principally to Gambusia predation. One major drawback as a use for an experimental analog such as lakes was the development of a periphyton growth which eventually overwhelmed the biomass of the system. The tanks displayed a degree of successional replicability, a large number of species, and a diversity of community development. Microcosms of this size could find use as experimental systems for higher level trophic manipulation and observation of life cycles not amenable to field studies.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Exotic species have frequently caused declines of native fauna and may contribute to some cases of amphibian decline. Introductions of mosquitofish ( Gambusia affinis) and bullfrogs ( Rana catesbeiana) are suspected to have caused the decline of California red-legged frogs ( Rana aurora draytonii). We tested the effects of mosquitofish and bullfrog tadpoles on red-legged frog tadpoles in spatially complex, speciose communities. We added 720 hatchling red-legged frog tadpoles to each of 12 earthen ponds. Three ponds were controls, 3 were stocked with 50 bullfrog tadpoles, 3 with 8 adult mosquitofish, and 3 with 50 bullfrogs plus 8 mosquitofish. We performed tests in aquaria to determine whether red-legged frog tadpoles are preferred prey of mosquitofish. Mosquitofish fed on a mixture of equal numbers of tadpoles and either mosquitoes, Daphnia, or corixids until {\textless} 50\% of prey were eaten; then we calculated whether there was disproportionate predation on tadpoles. We also recorded the activity of tadpoles in the presence and absence of mosquitofish to test whether mosquitofish interfere with tadpole foraging. Survival of red-legged frogs in the presence of bullfrog tadpoles was less than 5\%; survival was 34\% in control ponds. Mosquitofish did not affect red-legged frog survival, even though fish became abundant (approximately 1011 per pond). Two mechanisms may have blocked the effects of mosquitofish on tadpole survival: (1) fish ponds contained fewer predatory invertebrates, and (2) mosquitofish preferred other prey to red-legged frogs in laboratory trials. Red-legged frog tadpoles suffered more injuries in ponds with fish, however, and weighed 34\% less at metamorphosis. The growth decrease could have been caused by injuries or by lower foraging levels in the presence of fish. Laboratory results showed that young tadpoles were less active in the presence of mosquitofish. Although both mosquitofish and bullfrogs affected red-legged frogs, the impact of bullfrogs on the survival of red-legged frogs may contribute more strongly to their decline.},

	abstract = {The survival probability in a group of individuals may evolve in time due to the influence of a time-varying covariate. In this paper we present a model-based approach allowing the estimation of the functional link between the survival probability and a time-varying covariate when data are grouped and time-period censored. The approach is based on an underlying model consisting in non-stationary Markov processes and describing the survival of individuals. The underlying model is aggregated in time and at the group level to handle the group structure of data and the censoring. The aggregation yields a generalized non-linear mixed model. Then, a Bayesian procedure allows the estimation of the model parameters and the description of the link between the survival probability and the time-varying covariate. This approach is applied in order to explore the relationship between the daily survival probability of mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) and their time-varying lengths (small mosquitofish die with a higher rate than large ones because they are more affected by predation, cannibalism and environmental stress).},

	abstract = {Reproduction in all organisms is regulated by a wide range of environmental factors. In fishes, these include (among other factors): temperature, photoperiod, nutrition, and social interactions. In the past 50 years, an additional factor has emerged: anthropogenic pollution. Many widely used contaminants (PCBs, pesticides, fertilizers, plasticizers) are now distributed throughout our environment, particularly in aquatic systems. Several of these have been shown to disturb normal development, growth, and reproduction of vertebrates through disruptive interactions with the endocrine system.
In this extended seasonal study, we evaluated reproductive parameters in adult Gambusia holbrooki captured from two central Florida lakes: Lake Apopka (with a documented history of organochlorine contamination) and Lake Woodruff Wildlife Refuge (reference site). Relative to the Lake Woodruff population, males and females from Lake Apopka exhibited increased hepatosomatic indices; females also exhibited altered estradiol patterns and an unexpected increase in fecundity. Males from Lake Apopka exhibited increased testicular size, but decreased sperm counts and sperm viability in some months, particularly at the end of the reproductive season.
In a second suite of studies, we assessed reproduction, at one point during the breeding season, among adult Gambusia, captured from eight Florida springs with varying concentrations of nitrate. Nitrate contamination of Florida springs is a growing concern. In fact, nitrate concentrations in some springs exceed the EPA-established concentration limit for drinking water (10 mg/L NO3-N). Nitrate exposure is associated with altered development, reduced steroidogenesis, and diminished reproductive success in a number of species. In male mosquitofish exposed to elevated nitrate concentrations (4 to 5 mg/L NO3-N), we observed increased gonadosomatic index, reduced 11-ketotestosterone concentrations, and reduced sperm counts. Females from springs with elevated nitrate concentrations exhibited reduced embryo dry weights and a decreased rate of reproductive activity, based on presence or absence of vitellogenic oocytes.
Taken together, our results suggest that long-term exposure to environmental contaminants, specifically organochlorines and nitrate, is associated with altered reproductive outcomes. In addition, the temporal nature of our research greatly expands and integrates our knowledge of Gambusia reproduction in terms of seasonal variation and basic life history.},

	abstract = {Ecological invasions, where non-native species spread to new areas, grow to high densities and have large, negative impacts on ecological communities, are a major worldwide problem. Recent studies suggest that one of the key mechanisms influencing invasion dynamics is personality-dependent dispersal: the tendency for dispersers to have a different personality type than the average from a source population. We examined this possibility in the invasive mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). We measured individual tendencies to disperse in experimental streams and several personality traits: sociability, boldness, activity and exploration tendency before and three weeks after dispersal. We found that mosquitofish display consistent behavioural tendencies over time, and significant positive correlations between all personality traits. Most notably, sociability was an important indicator of dispersal distance, with more asocial individuals dispersing further, suggesting personality-biased dispersal on an invasion front. These results could have important ecological implications, as invasion by a biased subset of individuals is likely to have different ecological impacts than invasion by a random group of colonists.},

OPFRs were ubiquitous contaminants in water (ΣOPFRs ranging from 0.0076 to 7.2μgL−1) and sediments (ΣOPFRs ranging 3.8 to 824μgkg−1). Brominated flame retardants were not detected in waters, whereas ΣPBDEs ranged from 88 to 812μgkg−1 and decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) reached 435μgkg−1 in sediments from the River Besòs, the most impacted river. The occurrence of flame retardants in river water and sediment was clearly associated with human activities, since the highest levels occurred near urban and industrial zones and after wastewater treatment plants discharge. Daphnia magna toxicity was carried out for OPFRs, the most ubiquitous flame retardants, considering individual compounds and mixtures. Toxicity of nine tested OPFRs differed largely among compounds, with EC50 values ranging over three magnitude orders (0.31–381mgL−1). Results evidenced that these compounds act by non-polar narcosis, since their toxicity was proportional to their lipophilicity (Kow). Furthermore, their joint toxicity was additive, which means that single and joint toxicity can be predicted knowing their concentration levels in water using quantitative structure activity relationships (QSARs) and predictive mixture models. Based on these results, a risk assessment considering joint effect was performed calculating and summing risk quotients (RQs) for the water and sediment samples. No significant risk to D. magna (ΣRQs {\textless}1) was observed for any of the monitored rivers.},

They were produced from the 1930s until banned in the 1970s because of toxicity and evidence of widespread environmental contamination. They were used mostly as insulators in electrical equipment; their widespread occurrence in the environment is more a consequence of uncontrolled disposal than of deliberate dissemination. In Asia, there have been two outbreaks of poisoning due to cooking oil contaminated by thermally degraded PCBs. Studies in workers exposed chronically to "clean" PCBs, workers exposed acutely to thermally degraded PCBs in clean-up of fires, and adult patients in Asia who ingested contaminated rice oil consistently show slowed nerve conduction and sometimes show headache, lassitude, and other CNS symptoms. In children exposed to background levels in the US, those with the highest transplacental exposure show hypotonia and hyporeflexia at birth and slowed motor development through age two, a defect in visual memory processing at 7 mon, and defects in short term memory at 4 years. Despite the presence of PCBs in breast milk, no association between breast milk exposure and any measured outcome has been seen other than lower activity levels at 4 years among long term breast fed children at the highest PCB levels. In Asia, children who were in utero at or after the 1968 exposure in Japan or the 1979 exposure in Taiwan showed clinically evident developmental delay. In Taiwan, the children were shown to have a variety of ectodermal defects, but the association between these defects and developmental delay was weak.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Recently, environmental problems relating to brominated flame retardants (BFRs) have become a matter of greater concern than ever before, because of the recent marked increase in levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) found in human milk in Sweden and North America. The question that arises is whether environmental levels of PBDEs and other BFRs will continue to increase, causing toxic effects to humans. In an attempt to elucidate the current state of the science of BFRs, we review the consumer demand for BFRs (mainly in Japan), the characteristics of waste flame-retarded products, sources of emission, environmental behavior, routes of exposure of humans, temporal trends, and thermal-breakdown products of BFRs. At present, flame-retarded consumer products manufactured 10–20 years ago, when PBDEs were frequently used, are being dumped. The possible major sources of emission of BFRs into the environment are effluent and flue gases from BFR factories and other facilities processing BFRs. With respect to the environmental behavior of BFRs, the lower brominated compounds are, on the whole, predicted to be more volatile, more water soluble, and more bioaccumulative than the higher brominated compounds. The most probable route for exposure of the general human population to PBDEs, especially the lower brominated congeners, is through the diet. The release of BFRs from consumer products treated with these compounds could also lead to human exposure. Temporal trends in PBDE levels in the environment and in humans worldwide seem to vary considerably, depending on the regions or country, with possible reflections of the historic and current use of PBDEs. The environment and the general human population are also exposed to the thermal-breakdown products of PBDEs, such as polybrominated and mixed brominated/chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDDs/DFs and mixed PXDDs/DFs).},

	abstract = {What are Flame Retardants? Flame Retardants are any chemicals added to manufactured materials such as plastics, textiles and surface coatings, to inhibit, suppress, or delay the production of flames and prevent the spread of fire. They have been used in many consumer and industrial products, since the 1970s, to decrease the ability of materials to ignite. Inorganic and organic flame retardant have been used. There are three primary types of organic frame retardants: bromine (Br), chlorine (Cl) and phosphate (P). Many flame retardants are persistent organic pollutants POPs, toxic, man-made, hazardous chemical that have dangerous effects on the environment and our health. Flame Retardants: a succession of regrettable substitutions Repeatedly, flame retardants are removed from the market and/or their production is stopped when their toxicity to human and the environment is proven and/or they are officially recognized and listed under the Stockholm Convention a global treaty to protect human health and the environment from POPs. However, the need for flame retardants substances – real or perceived – linked to increased safety requirements incorporated in the regulations and standards of the manufacturing industries - means that new chemicals are continuously produced to replace the forbidden ones. This is a classic pattern for POPs of regrettable substitutions: introducing a toxic chemical, ban it after noticing its harmful impacts, then using a new chemical – probably equally toxic but not yet scrutinized and proven as so - to replace it. Mirex listed in 2004 was one of the first chemical used as flame retardant, followed by other Chlorinated chemicals such as PCB listed in 2004, and PeCB listed in 2009. They were replaced by Brominated chemicals: PBDEs tetraBDE / pentaBDE /hexaBDE / heptaBDE listed in 2009 and decaBDE listed in 2017, HBB listed in 2009, HBCD listed in 2013. The Chlorinated paraffins substituted the brominated chemicals: SCCP was listed in 2017, MCCP is proposed for listing. Fluorinated chemicals were shortly used as flame or fire retardant until recently: PFOS was listed in 2009, PFOA in 2019, PFHxS in 2022. Currently Phosphate chemicals (TDCP, TCEP, TnBP) are increasingly used for the purpose of reducing flammability.},

The highest concentrations of Dec 602, 604, and DP observed in tributaries of the Niagara River confirmed that past or ongoing manufacturing of these compounds at plants along the river were important sources to Lake Ontario. Dec 603 was detected in technical products of aldrin and dieldrin, and its spatial trend was consistent with historic pesticide usage. Similarly, CP was detected in technical products of chlordene and chlordane, and it was found in higher concentrations in sediments near urban areas, possibly related to past chlordane use in home termite control.},

	abstract = {An exponential level increase of the ubiquitous halogenated flame retardant (HFR) class polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) has been documented during the 1990s in endangered belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) from the St. Lawrence Estuary (SLE), Eastern Canada. The recent worldwide bans and regulations of PBDE mixtures led to their replacement by alternative HFRs (so-called emerging HFRs) that are increasingly being reported in various environmental compartments. There are, however, limited knowledge on the spatial and temporal trends of PBDEs and emerging HFRs in cetaceans, especially after restrictions on PBDE usage. The first objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of HFRs (35 PBDE congeners and 13 emerging compounds) in the blubber of belugas and minke whales (Balænoptera acutorostrata) found dead in the Estuary or Gulf of St. Lawrence as well as belugas from Nunavik (Canadian Arctic) collected as part of the Inuit subsistence hunt. A second objective was to investigate the trends of HFR concentrations in SLE beluga males between 1997 and 2013. PBDEs were the most abundant HFRs in all three whale populations, while hexabromobenzene (HBB), Chlordene Plus (CPlus), Dechlorane Plus (DP), and Dechlorane 604 Component B (Dec-604 CB) were quantified in the majority of blubber samples. Overall, concentrations of emerging HFRs were notably greater in SLE belugas compared to the two other whale populations, with the exception of DP and Dec-604 CB that were found in greater concentrations in Canadian Arctic belugas. No significant trend in blubber PBDE concentrations was found in SLE belugas during this 17-year period. This suggests that global PBDE regulations are too recent to observe changes in PBDE concentrations in belugas from this highly HFR-exposed environment. In contrast, concentrations of HBB and CPlus in SLE belugas decreased slightly from 1997 to 2013, while DP increased up until 2000 and decreased slightly thereafter. The occurrence and temporal variations of PBDEs and their replacement products in these cetaceans warrant continuous monitoring.},

Around 80\% of the targeted FRs were detected in air and dust from the sampling sites. The comparison of settled dust with floor dust revealed no statistical differences between median concentrations of the FRs (n = 12). Decabromodiphenyl ether and tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate showed the highest median floor dust concentrations in both environments. In the air samples, the highest concentrations were observed for 2,2′,4,4′-tetrabromodiphenyl ether and tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate. Remarkably, the emerging FR, 4-(1,2-dibromoethyl)-1,2-dibromocyclohexane, abbreviated as TBECH or DBE-DBCH, showed the highest indoor air concentrations reported in the literature (households, 77.9 pg/m3 and schools, 46.6 pg/m3). Good Spearman correlations between the FR concentrations in dust and air (0.36 {\textless} R {\textless} 0.76) showed that is possible to estimate the concentrations in air from analyzed dust, or vice versa. Sources and pathways of exposure to FRs were assessed for the households. The main findings were that frequent vacuum cleaning resulted in lower FR concentrations in dust and that dermal contact with dust, for both children and mothers, was as important for the intake of organophosphate FRs as dust ingestion.},

	abstract = {As an alternative to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) has become one of the most important new brominated flame retardants (NBFRs). However, little is known about whether this emerging contaminant may has an environmental fate similar to PBDEs. Sediments are the main sink for DBDPE in the aqueous phase. Worldwide concentration data, since it was first found in sediments to date, have been collated, and the following conclusions have been drawn. (1) DBDPE concentrations in sediments have increased rapidly, often with a higher risk of contamination in source discharge areas. Compared with other countries, DBDPE contamination in China is more severe, especially in Guangdong Province, which is closely related to its being an e-waste dismantling area. (2) The amount of DBDPE in surface sediments has exceeded that of legacy brominated flame retardants (BFRs), and data recorded in sediment cores also corroborate that DBDPE is replacing decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) as one of the most dominant NBFRs in the environment. (3) The exposure pathways of DBDPE include dietary intake, air or indoor dust intake, cutaneous absorption and endogenous exposure. For sediments, dietary exposure and endogenous exposure pathways need to be considered. Sediment DBDPE can enter the human body through bioenrichment such as contaminated seafood and the food chain. (4) DBDPE can exhibit neurotoxicity, thyrotoxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress in organisms. Long-term DBDPE exposure may increase hyperthyroidism risk and inhibit normal cells activity. This review focuses on the distribution characteristics and exposure risks of DBDPE in global water sediments, providing a strong reference for environmental management and related legal policy formulation. The next steps are to focus on continuous source monitoring, process control and sediment clean-up of DBDPE. The development of sustainable water management options for waste microplastics (MPs) and e-waste spiked with DBDPE is a priority.},

Considering the physicochemical similarities between novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) and BFRs, more and more evidence reveals the neurotoxic effects of NBFRs. We reviewed the neuro(endocrine) toxic effects of NBFRs in vivo and in vitro and discussed their action mechanisms based on the available information. The neurotoxic potential of NBFRs has been demonstrated through direct neurotoxicity and disruption of the neuroendocrine system, with adverse effects on neurobehavioral and reproductive development. Mechanistic studies have shown that the impact of NBFRs is related to the complex interaction of neural and endocrine signals. From disrupting the gender differentiation of the brain, altering serum thyroid/sex hormone levels, gene/protein expression, and so on, to interfere with the feedback effect between different levels of the HPG/HPT axis. In this paper, the mechanism of neurotoxic effects of NBFRs is explored from a new perspective-neuro and endocrine interactions. Gaps in the toxicity data of NBFRs in the neuroendocrine system are supplemented and provide a broader dataset for a complete risk assessment.},

Following initial debromination of BDE15, degradation of BDE3 to DE readily occurs, suggesting the rate-limiting step for anaerobic BDE15 degradation is conversion of BDE15 to BDE3. The photochemical degradation of BDE15 was also examined in organic (CH3CN and CH3OH) and aqueous (H2O:CH3CN; 1:1 v/v) solvent systems at 300 nm. Only photochemically induced reductive debromination was found to occur via homolytic C-Br bond cleavage, with no evidence of C-O bond cleavage or products arising from heterolytic bond cleavage.},

Seven of the substances analysed dominated Swedish imports of OPs in 1999, six of these are also listed as EU High Production Volume Chemicals. Eight of the substances were found in all samples. Tris(2-butoxyethyl)phosphate was the most abundant in most of the samples, with levels ranging from 0.014 to 5.3 g/kg followed by tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate, tris(chloropropyl)phosphate and tris(1,3-dichloropropyl)phosphate. In wipe test samples from computers, triphenyl phosphate proved to be the main component of the OPs analysed (4.0 μg/m2). Potential sources of these compounds include, inter alia, floor polish, polyvinylchloride floor coverings, upholstery and plastic products. The distribution patterns of the OPs differed between the sites and generally reflected the building materials and consumer products used in their vicinity.},

The burgeoning practice of land-applying biosolids as fertilizer creates an avenue for reintroduction of PBDEs to surface waters and aquatic sediments. Bioavailability of biosolids- and sediment-associated PBDEs was assessed using the freshwater oligochaete, Lumbriculus variegatus. Oligochaetes were exposed to composted biosolids (1,600 ng/g total PBDEs) and artificial sediment spiked with penta- and deca-brominated diphenyl ether (BDE) formulations (1,300 ng/g total PBDEs). Uptake (28-d exposure) and depuration (21 d) of eight congeners were studied. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers in both substrates were bioavailable, but bioaccumulation was 5 to 10 times greater from spiked artificial sediment. The congeners BDE 47 and BDE 99 were the most prevalent congeners in oligochaetes after exposure. Congener BDE 47 was more bioaccumulative, possibly due to the threefold greater depuration rate of BDE 99. Bioaccumulation of penta- and hexa-brominated congeners appeared to be affected more strongly by substitution pattern than degree of bromination. Uptake of BDE 209, the dominant congener in deca-BDE, was minimal. Accumulation of certain PBDE congeners from biosolids and sediments by benthos provides a pathway for transfer to higher trophic levels, and congener discrimination may increase with each trophic transfer.},

	abstract = {Seventeen halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) were concurrently analyzed in surface seawater and low atmospheric samples from the Bohai Sea during four research cruises. HFRs mainly existed in particulate phases, and in general decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) was the predominant compound in both air and water samples. Relatively high concentrations were observed in the water of Laizhou Bay (LB), where the largest manufacturing base of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in China is located and weak water exchange occurs. Transport from LB by coastal currents may be the main source of BFRs in some areas without emission sources. The HFRs in seawater exhibited distinct seasonal variation, with significantly higher concentrations in winter than those in summer. The controlling factors include the resuspension of sediment induced by large wind waves in winter and phytoplankton scavenging in spring and seawater stratification in summer. HFRs composition varied largely in different seasons, due to the different extents of riverine input and atmospheric deposition. Normally, for air masses passing through the nearby industrial regions, high concentrations of DBDPE (up to 1780 pg m−3) co-existed with high total suspended particle (TSP) levels (up to 150 μg m−3). The estimated atmospheric deposition fluxes of HFRs were 19, 51, and 80 kg season−1 in spring, summer, and winter, respectively, indicating that the Bohai Sea is a sink of HFRs via atmospheric deposition. This study has increased our understanding of the behaviors and fates of the legacy and novel HFRs in the shallow coastal sea.},

The ubiquitous occurrence of NBFRs in the aquatic environments and the potential adverse effects on aquatic organisms have initiated intense global concerns. The present article, therefore, identifies and analyzes the current state of knowledge on the occurrence, bioaccumulation, fates, and environmental and health risks of NBFRs in aquatic environments. The key findings from this review are that (1) the distribution of NBFRs are source-dependent in the global aquatic environments, and several NBFRs have been reported at higher concentrations than that of the legacy flame retardants; (2) high bioaccumulative properties have been found for all of the discussed NBFRs due to their strong hydrophobic characteristics and weak metabolic rates; (3) the limited information available suggests that NBFRs are resistant to biotic and abiotic degradation processes and that sorption to sludge and sediments are the main fate of NBFRs in the aquatic environments; (4) the results of ecological risk assessments have indicated the potential risks of NBFRs and have suggested that source areas are the most vulnerable environmental compartments. Knowledge gaps and perspectives for future research regarding the monitoring, toxicokinetics, transformation processes, and development of ecological risk assessments of NBFRs in aquatic environments are proposed.},

	abstract = {Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been used in a broad array of polymeric materials such as plastics, foams, resins and adhesives to inhibit the spread of fires since the 1970s. The widespread environmental contamination and well documented toxic effects of PBDEs have led to bans and voluntary withdrawals in many jurisdictions. Replacement novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) have, however, exhibited many of the same toxic characteristics as PBDEs and appear to share similar environmental fate. This paper presents a critical review of the scientific literature regarding PBDE and NBFR contamination of surface soils internationally, with the secondary objective of identifying probable pollution sources. An evaluation of NBFR distribution in soil was also conducted to assess the suitability of the newer compounds as replacements for PBDEs, with respect to their land contamination potential. Principle production of PBDEs and NBFRs and their consequent use in secondary polymer manufacture appear to be processes with strong potential to contaminate surrounding soils. Evidence suggests that PBDEs and NBFRs are also released from flame retarded products during disposal via landfill, dumping, incineration and recycling. While the land application of sewage sludge represents another major pathway of soil contamination it is not considered in this review as it is extensively covered elsewhere. Both PBDEs and NBFRs were commonly detected at background locations including Antarctica and northern polar regions. PBDE congener profiles in soil were broadly representative of the major constituents in Penta-, Octa- and Deca-BDE commercial mixtures and related to predicted market place demand. BDE-209 dominated soil profiles, followed by BDE-99 and BDE-47. Although further research is required to gain baseline data on NBFRs in soil, the current state of scientific literature suggests that NBFRs pose a similar risk to land contamination as PBDEs.},

This study investigates the environmental concentration, spatial distribution and source apportionment of eight OPFRs in surface soil (n = 28) from four major cities of Nepal with special interest on air-soil exchange. Overall, significantly high concentrations of ∑8OPFR were measured in soil ranging from 25–27,900 ng/g dw (median 248 ng/g dw). In terms of compositional pattern, tris(methyl phenyl) phosphate (TMPP) was the most abundant phosphorus chemical in soil, followed by tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP), and accounted for 35–49\% and 8–25\% of ∑8OPFRs, respectively. The high level of these OPFRs was attributed to local sources as opposed to transboundary influence from remote areas. A Spearman's rank correlation analysis exhibited weak correlation of ∑8OPFRs with TOC (Rho = 0.117, p {\textless} 0.05) and BC (Rho = 0.007, p {\textless} 0.05), suggesting little or no influence of TOC and BC on the concentration of ∑8OPFRs.

The tested BFRs, including polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexabromobenzene (HBB), and 1,2-dibromo-4-(1,2-dibromoethyl)cyclohexane (TBECH), were found to be bioavailable to Eisenia fetida, and they accumulated in the earthworms. To our knowledge, this is the first published study to address the bioaccumulation potential of TBECH in terrestrial biota. Aging the soil resulted in decreased accumulation of TBECH, HBB, and PBDEs with six or less bromine atoms. However, no effect of soil aging was seen for BDEs 183 or 209, possibly due to their low mobility in soil. The use of different soils (artificial OECD soil and two natural Swedish soils) also affected the degree of accumulation in the worms. The results indicate that use of the generally accepted standard OECD soil may overestimate accumulation of organic contaminants by earthworms, due to high bioavailability of the contaminants and/or weight loss of the worms in it. Further, the accumulation of selected PBDEs and HBB was compared to the accumulation of their chlorinated analogues. Brominated compounds accumulated to the same or a lesser extent than their chlorinated counterparts.},

	abstract = {Polybrominated diphenyl ether, PBDE, flame retardants are now a world-wide pollution problem reaching even remote areas. They have been found to bioaccumulate and there are concerns over the health effects of exposure to PBDEs, they also have potential endocrine disrupting properties. They are lipophilic compounds so are easily removed from the aqueous environment and are predicted to sorb onto sediments and particulate matter or to fatty tissue, aiding their distribution throughout the environment. PBDEs are structurally similar to PCBs and DDT and, therefore, their chemical properties, persistence and distribution in the environment follow similar patterns. Concentrations of PBDEs found in environmental samples are now higher than those of PCBs. Evidence to date demonstrates that PBDEs are a growing problem in the environment and concern over their fate and effects is warranted. The manufacture of reactive and additive flame retardants is briefly discussed and their fate and behaviour in the environment is assessed. PBDE toxicology is reviewed and methods of analysis are evaluated.},

	abstract = {Soil, vegetation, and several terrestrial species including turtledove, chicken, goose, grasshopper, dragonfly, butterfly and ant, were collected from an area surrounding a typical e-waste burning site in South China. The samples were examined to investigate the levels, congener profiles, and biomagnification extent of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) that may be present in the environment as a result of the e-waste, which was processed in a crude recycling style. Elevated levels of Σ21PBDEs were found in the biota (101–4725ngg−1 lipid weight (lw)), vegetation leaf (82.9–319ngg−1 dry weight (dw)) and soil samples (5.2–22110ngg−1 dw), indicating that PBDE contamination in the samples collected from the e-waste burning site may pose risks to the local terrestrial ecosystem and local populations. Higher BDE congeners, especially deca-BDE (BDE-209) were the dominant homologs in organisms and nonbiological matrices, followed by nona-BDE and octa-BDE. Biomagnification factors (BMFs) were calculated as the ratio of the lipid-normalized concentration in the predator to that in the prey. The highest BMF (3.4) was determined for BDE-153 in the grasshopper/turtledove food chain. Other higher brominated congeners, such as BDE-202, -203, -154, -183 and -209, were also biomagnified in the terrestrial food chain with BMFs of 1.7–3.3. BDE-47, -100, and -99 were not biomagnified in the examined food chains (BMFs{\textless}1), which suggests that bioaccumulation and biotransformation of PBDEs in terrestrial ecosystems could be distinguished from those in aquatic ecosystems.},

Additionally, one influent and one effluent sample of waste water from a local waste water treatment plant were investigated. The applied analytical method is based on solid phase extraction (SPE), in order to concentrate polar compounds from water samples, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of the extracts. A total of 5 l of the respective water samples was used for extraction purposes and analyte recoveries were all ≥83\%. The detection limit for the target analytes was 1 ng l−1 and the relative standard deviations for replicate injections (n = 10) were 14.0\% for TBP, 12.6\% for TCEP and 9.9\% for TBEP. The presence of the organophosphorus compounds, TBP, TCEP and TBEP, in Germany has resulted in water concentrations of 17–1510 ng l−1 in the Rhine, Elbe, Main, Oder, Nidda and Schwarzbach Rivers. The maximum value of TBP measured in the Rhine River was 17 times lower than the maximum value measured 10 years ago. The maximum value of TCEP measured in the Rhine River was 100 times lower than the maximum value measured in previous investigations. The maximum concentration of TBEP measured in the Elbe River was seven times higher than the value measured 16 years ago. Similar concentrations of TBP, TCEP and TBEP were also detected in ground water and rain water. The highest levels of these compounds were detected in samples of waste water.},

	abstract = {Polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants showing rapid temporal increase in some sample types. The compounds are known to biomagnify in aquatic food webs and are assumed to archive into sediments and soils. Currently, no direct evidence indicates whether sediment-associated PBDEs are available for biota. The aim of the present study was to explore the uptake and elimination of two common congeners (47 and 99) in sediment-inhabiting invertebrates to shed light on possible bioavailability of sediment-associated PBDEs. Two clean lake sediments were spiked with environmentally relevant concentrations of 14C-labeled tetra- and pentabromo diphenylether, and oligochaetes (Lumbriculus variegatus) were exposed for three or four weeks to allow kinetic accumulation calculations. Subsequent depuration tests were performed after three weeks of exposure to obtain depuration rates. Both congeners were clearly bioavailable, and only slight differences in steady-state tissue concentrations were found between the four sediment-ingesting oligochaete treatments (biota sediment accumulation factors [BSAFs], 3.0–3.7). The tetrabromo diphenylether-exposed oligochaetes that did not ingest sediment had clearly lower influx rates (0.1 vs 1–3 nmol h-1) than sediment-ingesting worms. Also, the estimated BSAF (1.8) was statistically different from that of the sediment-ingesting oligochaetes. These findings support the significance of feeding behavior in bioaccumulation of very hydrophobic organic contaminants. Depuration of both congeners was biphasic, indicating two kinetically different compartments in L. variegatus. Compartment A made up 73 to 92\% of total radioactivity in tissues and had relatively fast depuration rates (half-lives, 10.5–47.5 h); the smaller compartment B had very slow depuration rates. No significant biotransformation of PBDEs was evident. The present study clearly demonstrates that the sediment-associated PBDEs, like other hydrophobic organic contaminants of environmental concern, are not totally sequestered from sediment-inhabiting oligochaetes and are subject to trophic transfer.},

	abstract = {What are Flame Retardants? Flame Retardants are any chemicals added to manufactured materials such as plastics, textiles and surface coatings, to inhibit, suppress, or delay the production of flames and prevent the spread of fire. They have been used in many consumer and industrial products, since the 1970s, to decrease the ability of materials to ignite. Inorganic and organic flame retardant have been used. There are three primary types of organic frame retardants: bromine (Br), chlorine (Cl) and phosphate (P). Many flame retardants are persistent organic pollutants POPs, toxic, man-made, hazardous chemical that have dangerous effects on the environment and our health. Flame Retardants: a succession of regrettable substitutions Repeatedly, flame retardants are removed from the market and/or their production is stopped when their toxicity to human and the environment is proven and/or they are officially recognized and listed under the Stockholm Convention a global treaty to protect human health and the environment from POPs. However, the need for flame retardants substances – real or perceived – linked to increased safety requirements incorporated in the regulations and standards of the manufacturing industries - means that new chemicals are continuously produced to replace the forbidden ones. This is a classic pattern for POPs of regrettable substitutions: introducing a toxic chemical, ban it after noticing its harmful impacts, then using a new chemical – probably equally toxic but not yet scrutinized and proven as so - to replace it. Mirex listed in 2004 was one of the first chemical used as flame retardant, followed by other Chlorinated chemicals such as PCB listed in 2004, and PeCB listed in 2009. They were replaced by Brominated chemicals: PBDEs tetraBDE / pentaBDE /hexaBDE / heptaBDE listed in 2009 and decaBDE listed in 2017, HBB listed in 2009, HBCD listed in 2013. The Chlorinated paraffins substituted the brominated chemicals: SCCP was listed in 2017, MCCP is proposed for listing. Fluorinated chemicals were shortly used as flame or fire retardant until recently: PFOS was listed in 2009, PFOA in 2019, PFHxS in 2022. Currently Phosphate chemicals (TDCP, TCEP, TnBP) are increasingly used for the purpose of reducing flammability.},

Levels and possible sources of both compound classes are discussed. Odontocete cetaceans accumulate higher PBDE concentrations than mysticete species. PBDE contamination was higher in cetaceans from the Northern hemisphere, whereas MeO-PBDE levels were higher in animals from the Southern hemisphere. Southern resident killer whales from NE Pacific presented the highest levels reported in biota, followed by bottlenose dolphins from North Atlantic (U.K. and U.S. coast). Many species presented PBDE concentrations above threshold levels for health effects in odontocetes. Time trend studies indicate that PBDE concentrations in odontocetes from Japan, China, U.S. and Canada coastal zones have increased significantly over the past 30years. Studies from U.K. waters and NE Atlantic showed a decrease and/or stability of PBDE levels in cetacean tissues in recent decades. The highest MeO-PBDE concentrations were found in dolphins from Tanzania (Indian Ocean), bottlenose dolphins from Queensland, Australia (SW Pacific), and odontocetes from coastal and continental shelf waters off southeastern Brazil (SW Atlantic). The upwelling phenomenon and the presence of coral reef complexes in these tropical oceans may explain the large amounts of the naturally-produced organobromines. Considering that these bioaccumulative chemicals have properties that could cause many deleterious effects in those animals, future studies are required to evaluate the potential ecotoxicological risks.},

The environmental safety of brominated flame retardants, especially their persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity is a controversial topic. Here, we studied and compared the degradation of TBBPA, HBCD, and DecaBDE under anaerobic conditions in digested sewage sludge. The half-lives of TBBPA and a technical HBCD mixture were 0.59 and 0.66d, respectively. The fact that (±)-α-HBCD exhibited an almost doubled half-life compared to (±)-β-HBCD and (±)-γ-HBCD is an important finding with respect to the discussion on the persistence of individual HBCD stereoisomers and the recent reports on strong relative enrichment of α-HBCD in biota. We found no statistically significant enantioselective degradation of α-, β-, or γ-HBCD. Half-lives of TBBPA and a technical HBCD mixture were not dependent on the presence of additional nutrients or primers. Concentrations of TBBPA and a technical HBCD mixture decreased also in sterile control samples, however, at a rate that was more than a factor of 50 smaller than in incubations under non-sterile conditions. Compared to TBBPA and a technical HBCD mixture, DecaBDE exhibited a much longer half-life of 7×102d in the same system. Pseudo-first-order degradation rate constants decreased according to the following sequence: TBBPA≅(±)-γ-HBCD≅(±)-β-HBCD{\textgreater}(±)-α-HBCD≫DecaBDE. Preliminary investigations suggest that degradation of TBBPA, HBCD, and DecaBDE occurs in full-scale anaerobic digesters, as well.},

In this study, we obtained time-resolved strain distributions via three-dimensional digital image correlation (DIC) for the outer and inner trap-lobe surfaces throughout the closing motion. In combination with finite element models, the various possible contributions of the trap tissue layers were investigated with respect to the trap’s movement behavior and the amount of strain required for snapping. Supported by in vivo experiments, we show that full trap turgescence is a mechanical–physiological prerequisite for successful (fast and geometrically correct) snapping, driven by differential tissue changes (swelling, shrinking, or no contribution). These are probably the result of the previous accumulation of internal hydrostatic pressure (prestress), which is released after trap triggering. Our research leads to an in-depth mechanical understanding of a complex plant movement incorporating various actuation principles.},

The movement of plants or plant parts occurs over a wide range of sizes and time scales. This review summarizes the main physical mechanisms plants use to achieve motility, highlighting recent work at the frontier of biology and physics on rapid movements. Emphasis is given to presenting in a single framework pioneering biological studies of water transport and growth with more recent physics research on poroelasticity and mechanical instabilities. First, the basic osmotic and hydration/dehydration motors are described that contribute to movement by growth and reversible swelling/shrinking of cells and tissues. The speeds of these water-driven movements are shown to be ultimately limited by the transport of water through the plant body. Some plant structures overcome this hydraulic limit to achieve much faster movement by using a mechanical instability. The principle is to impose an ‘energy barrier’ to the system, which can originate from geometrical constraint or matter cohesion, allowing elastic potential energy to be stored until the barrier is overcome, then rapidly transformed into kinetic energy. Three of these rapid motion mechanisms have been elucidated recently and are described here: the snapping traps of two carnivorous plants, the Venus flytrap and Utricularia, and the catapult of fern sporangia. Finally, movement mechanisms are reconsidered in the context of the timescale of important physiological processes at the cellular and molecular level.},

	abstract = {Plant movements are generally slow, but some plant species have evolved the ability to move very rapidly at speeds comparable to those of animals. Whereas movement in animals relies on the contraction machinery of muscles, many plant movements use turgor pressure as the primary driving force together with secondarily generated elastic forces. The movement of stomata is the best-characterized model system for studying turgor-driven movement, and many gene products responsible for this movement, especially those related to ion transport, have been identified. Similar gene products were recently shown to function in the daily sleep movements of pulvini, the motor organs for macroscopic leaf movements. However, it is difficult to explain the mechanisms behind rapid multicellular movements as a simple extension of the mechanisms used for unicellular or slow movements. For example, water transport through plant tissues imposes a limit on the speed of plant movements, which becomes more severe as the size of the moving part increases. Rapidly moving traps in carnivorous plants overcome this limitation with the aid of the mechanical behaviors of their three-dimensional structures. In addition to a mechanism for rapid deformation, rapid multicellular movements also require a molecular system for rapid cell-cell communication, along with a mechanosensing system that initiates the response. Electrical activities similar to animal action potentials are found in many plant species, representing promising candidates for the rapid cell–cell signaling behind rapid movements, but the molecular entities of these electrical signals remain obscure. Here we review the current understanding of rapid plant movements with the aim of encouraging further biological studies into this fascinating, challenging topic.},

	abstract = {Carnivorous aquatic Utricularia species catch small prey animals using millimetre-sized underwater suction traps, which have fascinated scientists since Darwin's early work on carnivorous plants. Suction takes place after mechanical triggering and is owing to a release of stored elastic energy in the trap body accompanied by a very fast opening and closing of a trapdoor, which otherwise closes the trap entrance watertight. The exceptional trapping speed—far above human visual perception—impeded profound investigations until now. Using high-speed video imaging and special microscopy techniques, we obtained fully time-resolved recordings of the door movement. We found that this unique trapping mechanism conducts suction in less than a millisecond and therefore ranks among the fastest plant movements known. Fluid acceleration reaches very high values, leaving little chance for prey animals to escape. We discovered that the door deformation is morphologically predetermined, and actually performs a buckling/unbuckling process, including a complete trapdoor curvature inversion. This process, which we predict using dynamical simulations and simple theoretical models, is highly reproducible: the traps are autonomously repetitive as they fire spontaneously after 5–20 h and reset actively to their ready-to-catch condition.},

	abstract = {The present paper deals with the question whether the door mechanism in Utricularia is an irritable one (as e.g., Mimosa is irritable) or is mechanical, and in the opening paragraphs the two views are set forth together with mention of the protagonists and their factual contributions. In particular the recently published views of Kruck have been examined and found to be inadequate.(a) The evidence for the conclusions herein presented have been drawn from a study of the posture of the door, and its exact positional relations to the threshold. The correlated anatomical facts have been studied and set forth, and it has been shown that the physical properties of the door do not change during action and that its action depends wholly on the pressure of the external medium (water) induced by the out-pumping capacity of the walls of the trap, first observed by Brocher, on the water-tightness of the door procured by the velum, as shown by Lloyd, and upon the actuation of a tripping mechanism also earlier described by the same author. There are no changes in turgor in the door cells and no reception or transmission of stimuli by the bristles, which are simply a part of the tripping mechanism.(b) Evidence has also been obtained from a study of the flexures and movements of the door, and it is shown that such could not occur if there were changes in turgor. It is further shown that the histology of the door and threshold are correlated with the position, degree and direction of the flexures.(c) It has been shown that during the flexures and movements of the door, there is no change in the position or form of the air contained in the intercellular spaces of the door, such as have been said to occur as a result of the movement of sap into these intercellular spaces.(d) Killing of the bristles does not prevent the action of the door, although it has been postulated that the bristles receive and transmit stimuli to the tissues of the door.(e) The rate of movement of the door during action is so rapid that, while it does not preclude the interpretation that it is an irritable response, it at least exposes it to grave doubt. Since the action can be repeated as rapidly and as often as the experimental conditions permit there can be no period of recovery. The action is so rapid that, if the mechanism is an irritable one, the latent period, or the period of transmission, must be very much shorter than any other case in the plant kingdom.The conclusion is therefore reached that the mechanism of the door is purely mechanical, though this is not to say that the trap is purely passive, since the physiological activity of the walls has to play its part in exhausting water from the interior, as a reduced water pressure within is necessary for the action of the door.A comparative study of 75 species of Utricularia supports this conclusion.},

Once introduced to islands, cats prey on a variety of native species many of which lack evolved defenses against mammalian predators and can suffer severe population declines and even extinction. As islands house a disproportionate share of terrestrial biodiversity, the impacts of invasive cats on islands may have significant biodiversity impacts. Much of this threatened biodiversity can be protected by eradicating cats from islands. Information on the relative impacts of cats on different native species in different types of island ecosystems can increase the efficiency of this conservation tool. We reviewed feral cat impacts on native island vertebrates. Impacts of feral cats on vertebrates have been reported from at least 120 different islands on at least 175 vertebrates (25 reptiles, 123 birds, and 27 mammals), many of which are listed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. A meta-analysis suggests that cat impacts were greatest on endemic species, particularly mammals and greater when non-native prey species were also introduced. Feral cats on islands are responsible for at least 14\% global bird, mammal, and reptile extinctions and are the principal threat to almost 8\% of critically endangered birds, mammals, and reptiles.},

            Extinctions have altered island ecosystems throughout the late Quaternary. Here, we review the main historic drivers of extinctions on islands, patterns in extinction chronologies between islands, and the potential for restoring ecosystems through reintroducing extirpated species. While some extinctions have been caused by climatic and environmental change, most have been caused by anthropogenic impacts. We propose a general model to describe patterns in these anthropogenic island extinctions. Hunting, habitat loss and the introduction of invasive predators accompanied prehistoric settlement and caused declines of endemic island species. Later settlement by European colonists brought further land development, a different suite of predators and new drivers, leading to more extinctions. Extinctions alter ecological networks, causing ripple effects for islands through the loss of ecosystem processes, functions and interactions between species. Reintroduction of extirpated species can help restore ecosystem function and processes, and can be guided by palaeoecology. However, reintroduction projects must also consider the cultural, social and economic needs of humans now inhabiting the islands and ensure resilience against future environmental and climate change.},

	abstract = {Insular environments, ranging from oceanic islands to fragments of once-contiguous natural systems, have long been used by biologists to test basic principles of ecology, evolution and biogeography. More recently, insular environments have figured prominently in conservation ecology, where the aim has usually been to conserve species or assemblages unique to isolated habitats. Improving the level of communication among the evolutionary biologists, theoretical ecologists and conservation biologists who study insular biotas will work to the benefit of all. This volume was inspired by a recent conference on the ecology of insular biotas, in which participants from a wide range of disciplines came together to compare ecological processes across a variety of taxonomic groups inhabiting a wide range of isolated environments. In this introduction, we point out the themes underlying these very diverse contributions. First we elaborate on the value of islands for elucidating processes underlying ecosystem functioning, population dynamics of reintroduced species, and restoration of disturbed habitats, and emphasize those areas where the use of islands could be expanded. The second section focuses on the link between ecology and evolutionary processes in insular systems and includes examples from oceanic islands, naturally patchy habitats and recently fragmented habitats. The third section illustrates some of the ways that invasive alien species on oceanic islands affect plant–animal mutualisms, particularly seed dispersal and pollination. The final section, on consequences of habitat fragmentation, focuses mainly on studies that describe the consequences that fragmentation has for plants and animals as they are forced into artificially insular environments. We close with a study that points out the differences among types of insular systems and identifies gaps in our knowledge of insular biotas, particularly the importance of explicitly incorporating patch type, age and patch–matrix contrasts in research. Finally, we recommend a greater emphasis on linking ecological theory and applied research, and improving communication between those who ask basic ecological questions and those who use insular systems for conservation.},

	abstract = {Aim I propose and develop a new classification system to explain diversity patterns in habitat fragments, equally applicable to islands and other inherently patchy ecosystems. My primary goal is to provide an inclusive model to improve the comparability of studies and enhance future efforts to synthesize their findings, yielding a generalized basis for understanding species composition in patchy ecosystems. Results Differentiating islands from fragments and incorporating patch age and patch: matrix contrast, eight classes of patch are distinguished, spanning a range of geographical features. To compare studies of diversity patterns among and between patch types, patch biota are divided into three categories based on their origin—relict species (present before fragmentation), matrix-derived species and interpatch dispersers. Applying this novel scheme to existing data, the effects of insularization are synthesized. Direct comparisons among fragments revealed broad similarity in the long-term effects of habitat fragmentation compared with highly divergent patterns in younger landscapes ({\textless}200 years). Holding patch: matrix contrast and age constant, fragments and islands were compared. Despite initial differences in community assembly, the biota of islands and fragments converge in several properties over time, as diversities stabilize and patch biotas become distinct from the surrounding matrix. Main conclusions Although necessarily broad, this framework provides an explicit context within which to test forty-four specific predictions regarding the distribution of diversity in patchy landscapes and thereby gain a clearer understanding of the long-term biological consequences of insularization. I propose that the fragments-as-islands analogy be revisited, potentially yielding valuable insight into the long-term future awaiting anthropogenically altered ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Island biogeography is the study of the distribution and dynamics of species in island environments. Due to their isolation from more widespread continental species, islands are ideal places for unique species to evolve, but they are also places of concentrated extinction. Not surprisingly, they are widely studied by ecologists, conservationists and evolutionary biologists alike. There is no other recent textbook devoted solely to island biogeography, and a synthesis of the many recent advances is now overdue. This second edition builds on the success and reputation of the first, documenting the recent advances in this exciting field and explaining how islands have been used as natural laboratories in developing and testing ecological and evolutionary theories. In addition, the book describes the main processes of island formation, development and eventual demise, and explains the relevance of island environmental history to island biogeography. The authors demonstrate the huge significance of islands as hotspots of biodiversity, and as places from which disproportionate numbers of species have been extinguished by human action in historical time. Many island species are today threatened with extinction, and this work examines both the chief threats to their persistence and some of the mitigation measures that can be put in play with conservation strategies tailored to islands.},

	abstract = {For decades, botanists have recognized that rare plants are clustered into ecological “islands”: small and isolated habitat patches produced by landscape features such as sinkholes and bedrock outcrops. Insular ecosystems often provide unusually stressful microhabitats for plant growth (due, for example, to their characteristically thin soils, high temperatures, extreme pH, or limited nutrients) to which rare species are specially adapted. Climate-driven changes to these stressors may undermine the competitive advantage of stress-adapted species, allowing them to be displaced by competitors, or may overwhelm their coping strategies altogether. Special features of insular ecosystems – such as extreme habitat fragmentation and association with unusual landscape features – could also affect their climate sensitivity and adaptive capacity. To help predict and manage climate-change impacts, I present a simple conceptual framework based on a synthesis of over 300 site-level studies. Using this framework, conservation efforts can leverage existing ecological knowledge to anticipate habitat changes and design targeted strategies for conserving rare species.},

	abstract = {The flora and fauna of oceanic islands have inspired research since the early scientific explorations. Islands can be considered ‘nature's test tubes’— simple systems with multiple replicates. Our research has used the simplicity of island systems to understand ecological community dynamics and to compare the properties of island communities with those in more complex mainland systems. Here, we present three topics: (i) current patterns of biodiversity on isolated islands of the Pacific; (ii) current patterns of disturbance and invasion on islands; and (iii) future trajectories inferred from these patterns. We examine features of islands (in particular, topography and isolation) that have allowed for given levels and distribution of endemicity. The extent to which island communities are impacted by, resist or accommodate disturbance and/or invasions by nonindigenous species appears to be dictated to a large extent by properties of the native communities and how these communities were originally assembled. Accordingly, patterns of disturbance and invasion are very different for high (montane) islands that are extremely isolated compared to those that are nearer to a source of natural migrants. As with all biotas, those on islands are dynamic entities. However, the unique aspect of islands is their isolation, and extreme isolation has largely been lost over the course of the last few centuries due to the development of transportation routes. We argue that such a modified dynamic will affect the future of the biota and the processes that gave rise to the biota. Specifically for isolated habitats, ecological processes will become increasingly more likely to generate biodiversity than evolutionary processes which have been relatively more important in the past. In the short term, island biotas and other similar biotas that occur in montane habitats may fare well as species are often abundant locally in the habitat to which they are indigenous, and may demonstrate considerable resistance and resilience to invasion. However, island biotas — and other biotas that show high local endemism — will likely not fare well in the face of prolonged disturbance. The biotas in these areas generally display a relatively low dispersal capacity; therefore, under conditions of long-term habitat modification, isolated biotas are likely to be swamped by non-natives, which — simply because of random processes and higher propagule pressure — will move more readily into available habitats. Thus, despite the importance of incorporating the evolutionary process into conservation efforts, we must also be careful to evaluate the likely form that the processes will take when the context (specifically, extent of isolation) has been highly modified.},

In this book, the authors developed a general theory to explain the facts of island biogeography. The theory builds on the first principles of population ecology and genetics to explain how distance and area combine to regulate the balance between immigration and extinction in island populations. The authors then test the theory against data. The Theory of Island Biogeography was never intended as the last word on the subject. Instead, MacArthur and Wilson sought to stimulate new forms of theoretical and empirical studies, which will lead in turn to a stronger general theory. Even a third of a century since its publication, the book continues to serve that purpose well. From popular books like David Quammen's Song of the Dodo to arguments in the professional literature, The Theory of Island Biogeography remains at the center of discussions about the geographic distribution of species.

Understanding the intricacies of invasions and their consequences is central to ecology and biodiversity conservation. Extinctions are rarely random and often are influenced by a suite of factors. 2. We explored abiotic and biotic factors that correlate with the help to provide proximate explanations for insular extinctions driven by invasive predators on islands off western Mexico. 3. A number of factors that were hypothesized a priori to explain the observed extinction patterns performed better than island size alone. Alternative prey available to invasive predators was negatively correlated with extinction, with twice the number of alternative prey species present on extinction-free islands compared to islands with extinctions. Carrying capacity estimates of extant populations were 27 times that of extinct populations. 4. An aggregate model that included alternative prey, carrying capacity, and seasonal precipitation was the best performing model. Those factors, which are supported by theory and empirical evidence, are informative to conservation decision-makers. 5. Synthesis and applications. Islands with small native mammals and no, or few, alternative prey species available to invasive predators should be prioritized for eradication. By focusing regionally on a specific threat, we provide a framework to practitioners that aids in prioritizing invasive predator eradications to halt insular extinctions.},

Here we conduct a systematic review and quantitatively estimate mortality caused by cats in the United States. We estimate that free-ranging domestic cats kill 1.3–4.0 billion birds and 6.3–22.3 billion mammals annually. Un-owned cats, as opposed to owned pets, cause the majority of this mortality. Our findings suggest that free-ranging cats cause substantially greater wildlife mortality than previously thought and are likely the single greatest source of anthropogenic mortality for US birds and mammals.

	abstract = {Abstract: Feral cats are directly responsible for a large percentage of global extinctions, particularly on islands. We reviewed feral cat eradication programs with the intent of providing information for future island conservation actions. Most insular cat introductions date from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, whereas successful eradication programs have been carried out in the last 30 years, most in the last decade. Globally, feral cats have been removed from at least 48 islands: 16 in Baja California (Mexico), 10 in New Zealand, 5 in Australia, 4 in the Pacific Ocean, 4 in Seychelles, 3 in the sub-Antarctic, 3 in Macaronesia (Atlantic Ocean), 2 in Mauritius, and 1 in the Caribbean. The majority of these islands (75\%; n= 36) are small (≤5 km2). The largest successful eradication campaign took place on Marion Island (290 km2), but cats have been successfully removed from only 10 islands (21\%) of ≥10 km2. On Cousine Island (Seychelles) cat density reached 243 cats/km2, but on most islands densities did not exceed 79.2 cats/km2 (n= 22; 81\%). The most common methods in successful eradication programs were trapping and hunting (often with dogs; 91\% from a total of 43 islands). Frequently, these methods were used together. Other methods included poisoning (1080; monofluoracetate in fish baits; n= 13; 31\%), secondary poisoning from poisoned rats (n= 4; 10\%), and introduction of viral disease (feline panleucopaenia; n= 2; 5\%). Impacts from cat predation and, more recently, the benefits of cat eradications have been increasingly documented. These impacts and benefits, combined with the continued success of eradication campaigns on larger islands, show the value and role of feral cat eradications in biodiversity conservation. However, new and more efficient techniques used in combination with current techniques will likely be needed for success on larger islands.},

	abstract = {The domestic cat has been introduced on most islands worldwide, where it has established feral populations and is currently known to be one of the worst invasive mammalian predators. Predation is the strongest deleterious effect of cats on wildlife, inducing a direct negative impact on population size and dynamics, breeding success and changes in species assemblages. Direct predation is not the only damaging impact on native wildlife, since cats can be responsible for other poorly-documented underlying ecological impacts, like competition, hybridization, disease transmission, ecological process alteration, and behavioral change. Here, we pinpoint relevant examples of these ecological impacts, by searching for accurate data from published literature. We used electronic databases covering most of the world islands where the effects of cats were documented. Knowledge of these impacts can be of great importance to preserve insular ecosystem functions and persistence of endangered native species. We emphasize that direct predation processes should not be the only factor considered in the management of invasive cats on islands.},

	abstract = {Island biogeography is the study of the distribution and dynamics of species in island environments. Due to their isolation from more widespread continental species, islands are ideal places for unique species to evolve, but they are also places of concentrated extinction. Not surprisingly, they are widely studied by ecologists, conservationists and evolutionary biologists alike. There is no other recent textbook devoted solely to island biogeography, and a synthesis of the many recent advances is now overdue. This second edition builds on the success and reputation of the first, documenting the recent advances in this exciting field and explaining how islands have been used as natural laboratories in developing and testing ecological and evolutionary theories. In addition, the book describes the main processes of island formation, development and eventual demise, and explains the relevance of island environmental history to island biogeography. The authors demonstrate the huge significance of islands as hotspots of biodiversity, and as places from which disproportionate numbers of species have been extinguished by human action in historical time. Many island species are today threatened with extinction, and this work examines both the chief threats to their persistence and some of the mitigation measures that can be put in play with conservation strategies tailored to islands.},

	abstract = {We describe the external morphology of a new giant lizard found alive on La Gomera Island (Canarian Archipelago), which had been previously described from subfossil bones. Adult size (SVL 135-190 mm) is comparable with the two largest living species (G. simonyi and G. stehlini) of the genus. It differs from the other species of Gallotia in the low number of temporal scales (21-27), presence of one elongate interprefrontal scale (linearly depressed in center) that is very infrequent in most of its congeners (small when it is present), having two distinctive lateral lines of small blue spots, and in having a blackish-brown dorsum and ventral parts ivory white. According to subfossil data, based on tooth morphology and body size, this lizard seems to correspond to the putatively extinct subspecies (G. simonyi gomerana). This taxon is sufficiently distinct to be treated as a full species, G. gomerana. Molecular data analysis from mtDNA sequences (cytochrome b and 12S rRNA) indicate that G. gomerana is closely related to G. simonyi and G. intermedia. After prospecting 70 localities in La Gomera, we only found a very small and threatened population of this species in Valle Gran Rey, in the western part of the island and living in an area of less than 1 ha. A small population size (only six individuals are known) and a large number of feral cats in their habitat makes this lizard the most endangered vertebrate of the Canaries and Europe and one of the most threatened in all the world. The species is suspected to be on the brink of extinction, so conservation measures are urgently needed, including a captive breeding plan at Valle Gran Rey, close to the natural habitat. /// En el presente trabajo se describe la morfología externa de un nuevo lagarto gigante hallado en la isla de La Gomera (archipiélago canario), el cual había sido descrito a partir de huesos fósiles. Su talla (LHC: 135-190 mm) es comparable con la de los otros dos lagartos gigantes del género (G. simonyi y G. stehlini). Difiere en general de las otras especies de Gallotia en el bajo número de escamas de las regiones temporal (21-27), presencia de una escama alargada interprefrontal (deprimida linealmente en el centro) muy poco frecuente en la mayoría de las otras especies (reducida cuando existe), además de presentar dos líneas de pequeños ocelos azules en los flancos del cuerpo, un dorso marrón-negruzco y partes ventrales de color blanco marfil. De acuerdo con los datos presentados por Hutterer (1985), basados en la morfología de los dientes y la talla del animal, este lagarto parece corresponder con una de las dos subespecies extintas descritas por este autor (G. simonyi gomerana). Después de estudiar la morfología externa del nuevo lagarto, y teniendo en cuenta las claras diferencias existentes con las restantes especies, este lagarto debe ser considerado como una especie (G. gomerana). Datos moleculares, basados en las secuencias de ADN mitocondrial (citocromo b y 12S rARN), indican que G. gomerana está íntimamente emparentado con G. simonyi y G. intermedia. Después de prospectar 70 localidades en La Gomera solamente se pudo detectar una pequeña población de esta especie en Valle Gran Rey (extremo Oeste), la cual se encuentra muy amenazada y ocupa menos de 1 ha. El reducido tamaño de su población y el gran número de gatos asilvestrados presentes en este lugar hacen que este lagarto sea en la actualidad el vertebrado más amenazado de las islas Canarias y Europa, siendo además uno de los que presenta una situación de conservación más delicada en todo el mundo. Estos datos indican que la especie se encuentra al borde de la extinción por lo que se han de tomar medidas urgentes de conservación que incluyan un plan de cría en cautividad en Valle Gran Rey, en las inmediaciones de su hábitat natural.},

              Understanding fish movement in the Arctic is paramount during the current era of rapidly warming seas, receding sea ice and associated shifting species distributions and fishing effort. We synthesized the literature and identified key knowledge gaps on the movement ecology of Arctic cod (
              Boreogadus saida
              ) and Polar/Ice cod (
              Arctogadus glacialis
              , both Gadidae) in the context of climate change. Standardized web‐based English‐language literature searches yielded 51 articles directly relevant and 122 indirectly relevant for the movement ecology of these species combined. Most articles were primarily relevant to
              B. saida
              (85\% of total filtered articles), occurred during open water season (49/38\%) with focus on distribution (32/22\%), predators (30/22\%), seasonal spawning/feeding movements (22/19\%), sea ice association (22/26\%), climate change (20/15\%) and vertical movements (17/19\%) with few focused on horizontal dynamics (3/0\%;

Disproportionate data resolution has resulted in greater predictive power of movement models for the European (29\% of articles) and North American (86\%) Arctic regions relative to the logistically challenging Central Arctic Ocean and Russian‐Siberian Arctic shelves (both 7\%). The movements of circumpolar Arctic gadids are dependent on complex dynamics that include regional currents, the longevity of ice‐flows and polynyas, water stratification and coastal hydrology. Dependence on these interactive and often co‐dependent processes highlights major pathways and barriers to movement and distribution at higher latitudes. Despite a recent increase in impactful research, there is a critical need for more direct research on circumpolar gadid movements to aid understanding of climate change impacts on Arctic ecosystems and fisheries.},

	abstract = {Given the unique thermal history of the Antarctic continent, fishes of dominant suborder Notothenioidei offer a remarkable opportunity to study the physiological and biochemical characters gained and, conversely, lost during their evolutionary history and to map this information on the species phylogenetic trees. The availability of phylogenetically related notothenioid taxa living in a wide range of latitudes (in the Antarctic, sub-Antarctic and temperate regions) allows to look into the molecular bases of environmentally driven gene birth and death. This evolutionary perspective has also been supported by comparison of some features of the hemoprotein devoted to the oxygen transport in fish species living in the other polar region, the Arctic. The Arctic and Antarctic marine ichthyofaunas differ by age and isolation. Fishes of the two polar regions have undergone different regional histories which have engineered the physiological diversities, so that Antarctic fish are much more stenothermal than Arctic ones. Understanding the mechanisms of phenotypic response to cold exposure in species living at different latitudes in polar habitats offers fundamental insights into environmental adaptations. This review aims at surveying the current knowledge of molecular structure, functional features, phylogeny and adaptations of the hemoglobin of fish thriving in the Antarctic, sub-Antarctic and Arctic regions (with some excursions in the temperate latitudes). Investigating the evolutionary adaptations of hemoglobins to these environments can provide new insights into adaptation currently studied merely in temperate organisms, and can shed light into the convergent processes that evolved in response to thermal adaptations.},

	abstract = {In fish, haemoglobin adaptations govern survival and biodiversity under specific environmental conditions and physiological requirements. The study of haemoglobins is aimed at identifying key links between molecular and eco-physiological adaptations. Differences in haemoglobin properties arise from the interaction of the heme with specific residues in the primary structure, but modulation in regulatory processes and altered protein synthesis may be additional adaptations in response to environmental changes. Fish experience variations in oxygen availability, salinity, ionic composition, pH and temperature. Compared to the dominant suborder Notothenioidei in Antarctica, many Arctic species possess multiple haemoglobins with different functional properties, which might be selectively and differentially expressed to secure oxygen unloading in peripheral tissues including swim bladder and retina, suggesting a mechanism of labour sharing. Haemoglobin polymorphism may further increase the repertoire of oxygen-binding tetramers, as documented in Atlantic cod widely distributed in Arctic and temperate North Atlantic waters. This ecologically and economically important species copes with fluctuating physico-chemical conditions affecting oxygen availability, demand and binding properties by displaying novel regulatory and structural polymorphisms in the main β1 subunit. The tetraploid salmonid genome harbours more α and β globin genes than any other teleost examined, and thermal stress activates several subunits in Arctic charr, the most northern-living freshwater fish. Thus, the success of Arctic fish seem governed by evolutionary adaptation to waters having variable low temperatures and by plasticity to environmental and human-induced habitat changes. Current knowledge of the molecular and functional diversity of haemoglobins in Arctic fish is summarised and compared with Antarctic fish in this review.},

              Brain regions, cranial nerves, and sense organs in
              Muraenolepis microps
              , an Antarctic gadiform fish, were examined to determine which features could be attributed to a gadiform ancestry and which to habitation of Antarctic waters. We found that the central nervous system and sense organs are well developed, showing neither substantial regression nor hypertrophy. A detailed drawing of the brain and cranial nerves is provided. The rostral position of the olfactory bulbs and telencephalic size and lobation are common for the order. The optic tectum and corpus cerebelli are smaller than in most other gadiforms. The shape of the corpus cerebelli is not distinctive among gadiforms. The lateral line region is moderately well‐developed, but not hypertrophied to the extent seen in deep‐sea gadiforms. As is the case in gadids possessing barbels and elongated pelvic rays,
              Muraenolepis
              has well‐developed facial lobes, although these are smaller and more laterally positioned. The vagal lobes are deeply placed in the rhombencephalon and project into the fourth ventricle. The brain of
              Muraenolepis
              resembles that of a phyletically derived gadoid, especially a phycid, more than it resembles the brain of a phyletically basal macrourid. Two histological features of the diencephalon of
              Muraenolepis
              appear to be unique among gadiforms: a well‐organized thalamic central medial nucleus and subependymal expansions.
              Muraenolepis
              has a pure rod retina like many deep‐sea species but lacks the superimposed layers of rod outer segments. The histology of the nonvisual sense organs, especially the olfactory and external taste systems, are well‐developed in
              Muraenolepis
              but not hypertrophied. We relate our findings to what is known about neural morphology in other gadiforms and in phyletically distant notothenioids and liparids that are sympatric with
              Muraenolepis
              on the Antarctic shelf. The only feature that reflects an Antarctic existence is the diencephalic subependymal expansions, which within notothenioids mirror the habitation of cold waters and have been found in every Antarctic species examined to date. Although the waters of the Antarctic shelf are cold, dark, and deep, brain and sense organ morphology in
              Muraenolepis
              are remarkably free of extreme specialization. J. Morphol. 250:34–50, 2001. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {As most fish are ectotherms, their physiology is strongly affected by temperature. Temperature affects their metabolic rate and thus their energy balance and behavior, including locomotor and feeding behavior. Temperature influences the ability/desire of the fish to obtain food, and how they process food through digestion, absorb nutrients within the gastrointestinal tract, and store excess energy. As fish display a large variability in habitats, feeding habits, and anatomical and physiological features, the effects of temperature are complex and species-specific. The effects of temperature depend on the timing, intensity, and duration of exposure as well as the speed at which temperature changes occur. Whereas acute short-term variations of temperature might have drastic, often detrimental, effects on fish physiology, long-term gradual variations might lead to acclimation, e.g. variations in metabolic and digestive enzyme profiles. The goal of this review is to summarize our current knowledge on the effects of temperature on energy homeostasis, with specific focus on metabolism, feeding, digestion, and how fish are often able to “adapt” to changing environments through phenotypic and physiological changes.},

	abstract = {Temperature strongly regulates the distribution and fitness of ectotherms, and many studies have measured the temperature dependence of physiological performance in controlled laboratory settings. In contrast, little is known about how temperature influences ectotherm performance in the wild, so the ecological significance of physiological performance as measured in the laboratory is unclear. Our aim was to measure the temperature dependence of performance in the wild for several species of fishes and to explore how temperatures that maximize performance in the wild (ToptE) are related to species biogeographies. We gathered body activity and growth data from the wild for nine tropical and temperate fish species, and by fitting thermal performance curves to these data, compared ToptE to species-specific warm range boundary temperatures (the average temperature of the warmest month at equatorward range limits). To explore the degree to which trends in the wild reflect trends in physiological performance measured in the laboratory, we also compiled published data on the temperature dependence of aerobic metabolic scope in fishes and compared these to our wild fish data. We found ToptE in the wild was strongly correlated with warm range boundary temperatures, and that the difference between these two temperatures (the ‘environmental heating tolerance’) was smaller for more-tropical species. Comparison with laboratory data revealed that ToptE approaches warm boundary temperatures in the wild at the same rate that the optimal temperature for aerobic scope (ToptAS) approaches upper critical temperatures (upper Tcrit) for aerobic scope in the laboratory, meaning that environmental heating tolerances in wild fishes closely mirror physiological heating tolerance (i.e. upper Tcrit − ToptAS) in captive fishes. Our comparison of field- and laboratory-derived data highlights the ecological significance of aerobic metabolic scope in fishes and suggests wild fish species tend to perform best near the highest temperatures encountered in their range while maintaining a safety margin from the deleterious effects of upper critical temperatures.},

The gastrointestinal fluids were hyperosmotic to serum but no significant differences in osmolality were found between the two food types. The food type significantly affected the antifreeze activity of the mid-gut fluids. The hysteresis freezing points, –3.27±0.30°C and–2.44±0.11°C for B. saida and crustaceans,respectively, were significantly lower than that of serum(–1.99±0.07°C). Furthermore, an exceptionally large thermal hysteresis ranging from 1.47±0.19°C to 2.04±0.30°C was observed in the intestinal fluids of fish feeding on B. saida. Native gel electrophoresis revealed that the gastrointestinal fluids contained AFGPs in all the different size groups. However, differences in band intensities for the two food types suggest that the ingested food has an influence on the concentration of the different AFGP-sizes in these fluids. A decrease in band intensities combined with a drop in thermal hysteresis from mid-gut to hind-gut fluid suggests that absorption of AFGP or possibly degradation occur during digestion.},

	abstract = {Given the unique thermal history of the Antarctic continent, fishes of dominant suborder Notothenioidei offer a remarkable opportunity to study the physiological and biochemical characters gained and, conversely, lost during their evolutionary history and to map this information on the species phylogenetic trees. The availability of phylogenetically related notothenioid taxa living in a wide range of latitudes (in the Antarctic, sub-Antarctic and temperate regions) allows to look into the molecular bases of environmentally driven gene birth and death. This evolutionary perspective has also been supported by comparison of some features of the hemoprotein devoted to the oxygen transport in fish species living in the other polar region, the Arctic. The Arctic and Antarctic marine ichthyofaunas differ by age and isolation. Fishes of the two polar regions have undergone different regional histories which have engineered the physiological diversities, so that Antarctic fish are much more stenothermal than Arctic ones. Understanding the mechanisms of phenotypic response to cold exposure in species living at different latitudes in polar habitats offers fundamental insights into environmental adaptations. This review aims at surveying the current knowledge of molecular structure, functional features, phylogeny and adaptations of the hemoglobin of fish thriving in the Antarctic, sub-Antarctic and Arctic regions (with some excursions in the temperate latitudes). Investigating the evolutionary adaptations of hemoglobins to these environments can provide new insights into adaptation currently studied merely in temperate organisms, and can shed light into the convergent processes that evolved in response to thermal adaptations.},

	abstract = {The frigid waters of the polar oceans delimit the cold extreme for marine life. This is particularly true in the case of the thermally isolated Antarctic Ocean which is perpetually near or at freezing (−1.9 °C) due to the thermal barrier imposed by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current [1]. The most fundamental survival challenge faced by teleost fishes in these waters is a physical one — the threat of being frozen. The body fluids of marine teleosts including polar species are hyposmotic to sea water, 300–600 mOsM [2,3] versus 1000 mOsM, and thus have a higher colligative freezing point than the latter, −0.56 °C to −1.1 °C versus −1.86 °C. By these simple physical considerations alone, freezing death would be unavoidable especially in the presence of ice. Unlike some reptiles and amphibians, fish cannot survive even partial freezing of their body fluids. A number of polar and subpolar fishes had overcome this environmental challenge with a biological solution — they evolved ice-binding antifreeze proteins which enabled them to successfully colonize icy habitats that were otherwise out of their reach. The impact of the evolution of these unique antifreezing proteins on organismal and ecological success is manifested most strikingly in the case of the Antarctic notothenioid fishes — a single teleost suborder (Notothenioidei) that has come to dominate today’s Antarctic fish fauna in terms of species number (∼50\%) and biomass (≥90\%) [2,4–6].},

	abstract = {Evolutionary disparate Antarctic notothenioids and Arctic gadids have adapted to their freezing environments through the elaboration of essentially identical antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs). Here we show that this convergence of molecular identity, which evolved from unrelated parent genes, extends to convergence in physiological deployment. Both fish groups synthesize AFGPs in the exocrine pancreas from where they are discharged into the gut to inhibit the growth of ingested ice. Antifreeze glycoproteins not lost with the faeces are resorbed from the gut via the rectal epithelium, transported to the blood and ultimately secreted into the bile, from where they re-enter the gastrointestinal tract. Antifreeze glycoprotein recirculation conserves energy expenditure and explains how high levels of AFGPs reach the blood in notothenioids since, unlike Arctic gadids which also synthesize AFGP in the liver, AFGP secretion in notothenioids is directed exclusively towards the gastrointestinal lumen. Since AFGPs function by inhibiting ice crystal growth, ice must be present for them to function. The two fish groups are thus faced with an identical problem of how to deal with internal ice. Here we show that both accumulate AFGPs within ellipsoidal macrophages of the spleen, presumably adsorbed to phagocytosed ice crystals which are then held until a warming event ensues.},

Cytidine-to-uridine (C-to-U) RNA editing is a critical posttranscriptional modification in mitochondria and chloroplasts that is specific to flowering plants. Multiple organellar RNA-editing factors (MORFs) form a protein family that participates in C-to-U RNA editing, but little is known regarding their immune functions. Here, we report the identification of NbMORF8, a negative regulator of plant immunity to Phytophthora pathogens. Using virus-induced gene silencing and transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana, we show that NbMORF8 functions through the regulation of reactive oxygen species production, salicylic acid signaling, and accumulation of multiple Arg-X-Leu-Arg effectors of Phytophthora pathogens. NbMORF8 is localized to mitochondria and chloroplasts, and its immune function requires mitochondrial targeting. The conserved MORF box domain is not required for its immune function. Furthermore, we show that the preferentially mitochondrion-localized NbMORF proteins negatively regulate plant resistance against Phytophthora, whereas the preferentially chloroplast-localized ones are positive immune regulators. Our study reveals that the C-to-U RNA-editing factor NbMORF8 negatively regulates plant immunity to the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora and that mitochondrion- and chloroplast-localized NbMORF family members exert opposing effects on immune regulation.},

	abstract = {Innate immunity represents a trait common to plants and animals, based on the recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by the host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). It is generally assumed that a pathogen strain, or race, may have elaborated mechanisms to suppress, or evade, the PAMP-triggered immunity. Once this plan was successful, the colonization would have been counteracted by an adaptive strategy that a plant cultivar must have evolved as a second line of defence. In this co-evolutionary context, adaptive immunity and host resistance (cultivar-pathogen race/strain-specific) has been differently selected, in animals and plants respectively, to face specialized pathogens. Notwithstanding, plant host resistance, based on matching between resistance (R) and avirulence (avr) genes, represents a form of innate immunity, being R proteins similar to PRRs, although able to recognize specific virulence factors (avr proteins) rather than PAMPs. Besides, despite the lack of adaptive immunity preserved plants from autoimmune disorders, inappropriate plant immune responses may occur, producing some side-effects, in terms of fitness costs of induced resistance and autotoxicity. A set of similar defence responses shared from plants and animals, such as defensins, reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxylipins and programmed cell death (PCD) are briefly described.},

Locust biology is often linked to abiotic conditions like temperature and/or precipitation, fueling the perception that aside from active control, humans are not a key player in the interaction locusts have with their environment. However, several studies have shown that land management practices like grazing heavily influences locust-human linkages. In this review we synthesize published research and reports on connections between locust outbreaks and ranching. For this, we conducted an extensive literature search using Google Scholar on the 19 species of grasshoppers that are currently considered to be locusts or non-model locusts. Species were sorted according to their feeding guilds: 1) forb- and/or tree-feeding locusts; 2) mix-feeding locusts (grasses, forbs, and/or trees); 3) grass-feeding locusts. We reviewed their pest status, ecology, and relationship with grazing. We then discussed the overall data and draw general patterns on how locusts and locust control affect livestock grazing through various mechanisms (competition, nutritional preferences, pesticide use, nutrient cycling). We draw attention to “telecoupling” a process in which land management practices like grazing have ecological feedbacks on locust populations, which in turn affects food security in distant regions due to the migratory capacity of locusts. Finally, we present new perspectives for sustainable management practices that integrate understanding of land management.},

	abstract = {A long-term investigation of rangeland grasshopper assemblages in southeastern Wyoming has been undertaken to determine if: 1) population dynamics are eruptive or gradient, and 2) suppression of localized hot-spots (i.e., an infestion of economically damaging rangeland species at a density of ≥ 9.6 grasshoppers/ m2 originating in an area of 20 to 4,000 ha) will prevent large-scale outbreaks. Data from 1990-1994 (a regional interoutbreak period) suggest elements of both eruptive and gradient dynamics. The eruptive model is supported by spatial qualities of hot-spots (they are discrete areas averaging 820 ha), dynamics of untreated hot-spots (they can persist and expand), dynamics of treated hot-spots (they do not recover in the treated or adjacent areas in subsequent years), and pest population ecology (at least one species apparently has eruptive reproductive potential). The gradient model is supported by dynamics of outbreaks (infestations {\textgreater}7,000 ha were found without a preceding hot-spot), dynamics of hot-spots (most collapse without treatment), and properties of infested lands (hot-spots have consistent topographic and soil properties). The eruptive-gradient dichotomy may fail to adequately describe grasshopper outbreak dynamics because the models were developed from simple systems that are qualitatively different than rangeland grasshoppers. Based on existing data, we recommend that incipient infestations should be treated only if they exceed 250 ha and they persist for at least 2 yr. Preventative benefits of small-scale treatments are uncertain at this time, although preservation and recolonization of beneficial arthropods are enhanced with this approach.},

	abstract = {▪ Abstract  Control of grasshoppers and locusts has traditionally relied on synthetic insecticides, and for emergency situations this is unlikely to change. However, a growing awareness of the environmental issues associated with acridid control as well as the high costs of emergency control are expanding the demand for biological control. In particular, preventive, integrated control strategies with early interventions will reduce the financial and environmental costs associated with large-scale plague treatments. The recent development of effective oil formulations of Metarhizium anisopliae spores in Africa, Australia, and Brazil opens new possibilities for environmentally safe control operations. Metarhizium biopesticide kills 70\%–90\% of treated locusts within 14–20 days, with no measurable impact on nontarget organisms. An integrated pest management strategy, with an emphasis on the use of Metarhizium, that incorporates rational use of chemical pesticides with biological options such as the microsporidian Nosema locustae and the hymenopteran egg parasitoids Scelio spp., has become a realistic option.},

	abstract = {Locusts exhibit two interconvertible behavioral phases, solitarious and gregarious. While solitarious individuals are repelled from other locusts, gregarious insects are attracted to conspecifics and can form large aggregations such as marching hopper bands. Numerous biological experiments at the individual level have shown how crowding biases conversion towards the gregarious form. To understand the formation of marching locust hopper bands, we study phase change at the collective level, and in a quantitative framework. Specifically, we construct a partial integrodifferential equation model incorporating the interplay between phase change and spatial movement at the individual level in order to predict the dynamics of hopper band formation at the population level. Stability analysis of our model reveals conditions for an outbreak, characterized by a large scale transition to the gregarious phase. A model reduction enables quantification of the temporal dynamics of each phase, of the proportion of the population that will eventually gregarize, and of the time scale for this to occur. Numerical simulations provide descriptions of the aggregation's structure and reveal transiently traveling clumps of gregarious insects. Our predictions of aggregation and mass gregarization suggest several possible future biological experiments.},

	abstract = {In history, every occurrence of a desert locust plague has brought a devastating blow to local agriculture. Analyses of the potential geographic distribution and migration paths of desert locusts can be used to better monitor and provide early warnings about desert locust outbreaks. By using environmental data from multiple remote-sensing data sources, we simulate the potential habitats of desert locusts in Africa, Asia and Europe in this study using a logistic regression model that was developed based on desert locust monitoring records. The logistic regression model showed high accuracy, with an average training area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.84 and a kappa coefficient of 0.75. Our analysis indicated that the temperature and leaf area index (LAI) play important roles in shaping the spatial distribution of desert locusts. A model analysis based on data for six environmental variables over the past 15 years predicted that the potential habitats of desert locust present a periodic movement pattern between 40°N and 30°S latitude. The area of the potential desert locust habitat reached a maximum in July, with a suitable area exceeding 2.77 × 107 km2 and located entirely between 0°N and 40°N in Asia-Europe and Africa. In December, the potential distribution of desert locusts reached its minimum area at 0.68 × 107 km2 and was located between 30°N and 30°S in Asia and Africa. According to the model estimates, desert locust-prone areas are distributed in northern Ethiopia, South Sudan, northwestern Kenya, the southern Arabian Peninsula, the border area between India and Pakistan, and the southern Indian Peninsula. In addition, desert locusts were predicted to migrate from east to west between these areas and in Africa between 10°N and 17°N. Countries in these areas should closely monitor desert locust populations and respond rapidly.},

Since its inception in the mid-1970s, The Australian Plague Locust Commission (APLC) is responsible for monitoring, forecasting and controlling populations of several locust pest species across inland eastern Australia (ca. two million km2). Ground surveys are typically targeted according to prevailing environmental conditions. However, due to the sheer size of the region and limited resources, such surveys remain sparse. Here we develop daily time-step statistical models of populations of Chortoicetes terminifera (Australian plague locust) that can used to predict abundances when observations are lacking, plus uncertainties. We firstly identified key environmental covariates of locust abundance, then examined their relationship with C. terminifera populations by interpreting the responses of Generalized Additive Models (GAM). We also illustrate how estimates of C. terminifera abundance plus uncertainties can be visualized across the region. Our results support earlier studies, specifically, populations peak in grasslands with high productivity, and decline rapidly under very hot and dry conditions. We also identified new relationships, specifically, a strong positive effect of vapour pressure and sunlight, and a negative effect of soil sand content on C. terminifera abundance. Our modelling tool may assist future APLC management and surveillance effort.},

From 1954–2014, a preventive management program appeared to limit SAL populations, with only small- to moderate-scale treatments required, limited to outbreak areas in northwest Argentina. However, the lack of major locust outbreaks led to a gradual reduction in resources, and in 2015, the sudden appearance of swarms marked the beginning of a substantial upsurge, with many swarms reported initially in Argentina in 2015, followed by expansion into neighboring countries over the next few years. The upsurge required a rapid allocation of resources for management of SAL and a detailed examination of the improvements needed for the successful management of this species. This paper provides a review of SAL biology, management history, and perspectives on navigating a plague period after a 60-year recession.},

	abstract = {Aim Whether marine species can respond to ocean warming by changing their depth remains controversial. Some evidence suggests that species can deepen to cope with warming climates, whereas other studies have found ecologically constrained depth distributions. Our study focuses on generalizing the depth response of species to warming and elucidating whether some species display a larger change in depth than others. This might help us to understand the future distribution of marine species and communities. Location The Mediterranean Sea. Time period 1985–2017. Major taxa studied Fish, malacostracans and cephalopods. Methods We compiled depth records of species from bottom-trawl surveys encompassing 236 marine species across the steep climatic gradient of the Mediterranean Sea. These data represent the largest assessment, to date, of the potential of species to modify their depth distribution in response to spatially varying climate. Using environmental variables (e.g., sea surface temperature, bottom temperature and salinity), we elucidate the change in depth of species across different climatic gradients. We then test whether species traits (e.g., thermal preference, depth affinity and taxonomic relationship) explain the variation in depth response. Results We reveal a significant deepening of minimum depths (shallow depth limits) with increasing sea temperatures across the Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, we show that this deepening is uneven among species, in that cold-water species and eurytherms deepen more than warm-water species and stenotherms. In addition, deep-water species deepen more than shallow-water species. We also find surprising changes toward shallower maximal depths (deep depth limits) with warming, but this pattern is not entirely supported by our sensitivity analyses. Main conclusions These large changes across the Mediterranean Sea imply that progressively warmer oceans will compress the vertical distribution of marine organisms. However, given that different species will respond differentially, the future vertical distribution of marine communities will change in complex ways.},

	abstract = {Traditionally lower and upper temperature tolerances of fishes have been quantified in the laboratory via three different experimental approaches: the Fry or incipient lethal temperature (ILT), critical thermal (CTM) and chronic lethal (CLM) methodologies. Although these three experimental laboratory approaches generate endpoints which are quantitatively expressed as a temperature, are determined experimentally with random samples of fish acclimated to specific temperatures, and involve both time and temperature as major test variables, they do not quantify the same response. All three approaches generate valuable, albeit different, information concerning the temperature tolerance of a species. In this review we have summarized published research concerning the tolerance of North American freshwater fishes to dynamic changes in temperature, i.e., tolerance is tested by methods that gradually change temperatures until biological stress is observed. We found more than 450 individual temperature tolerances listed in 80 publications which present original dynamic temperature tolerance data for 116 species, 7 subspecies and 7 hybrids from 19 families of North American freshwater fishes. This total represents about 1/3 of the families and 1/6 of the known North American freshwater species. Temperature tolerance data were partitioned by experimental approach, i.e., critical thermal method (CTM) and chronic lethal method (CLM), and direction of temperature change. Although both CTM and CLM expose fish to dynamic changes in water temperature, these two methods differ in temperature change rates and test endpoints, and hence measure different aspects of thermal stress. A majority of the 80 studies employed CTM to assess temperature tolerance, in particular determination of CTmaxima. One or more CTmaxima has been reported for 108 fishes. Twenty-two fishes have reported highest CTmaxima of 40°C or higher. Several species in the family Cyprinodontidae have generated some of the highest CTmaxima reported for any ectothermic vertebrate. For a variety of reasons, data concerning tolerance of low temperatures are less plentiful. Low temperature tolerance quantified as either CTminima or CLminima were found for a total of 37 fishes. Acclimation temperature exerts a major effect on the temperature tolerance of most North American fish species and it is usually strongly linearly related to both CTmaxima and CTminima. Although we uncovered dynamic temperature tolerance data for 130 fishes, only a single dynamic, temperature tolerance polygon has been published, that for the sheepshead minnow, Cyprinodon variegatus.},

	abstract = {A fundamental question in evolutionary biology is how genetic novelty arises. De novo gene birth is a recently recognized mechanism, but the evolutionary process and function of putative de novo genes remain largely obscure. With a clear life-saving function, the diverse antifreeze proteins of polar fishes are exemplary adaptive innovations and models for investigating new gene evolution. Here, we report clear evidence and a detailed molecular mechanism for the de novo formation of the northern gadid (codfish) antifreeze glycoprotein (AFGP) gene from a minimal noncoding sequence. We constructed genomic DNA libraries for AFGP-bearing and AFGP-lacking species across the gadid phylogeny and performed fine-scale comparative analyses of the AFGP genomic loci and homologs. We identified the noncoding founder region and a nine-nucleotide (9-nt) element therein that supplied the codons for one Thr-Ala-Ala unit from which the extant repetitive AFGP-coding sequence (cds) arose through tandem duplications. The latent signal peptide (SP)-coding exons were fortuitous noncoding DNA sequence immediately upstream of the 9-nt element, which, when spliced, supplied a typical secretory signal. Through a 1-nt frameshift mutation, these two parts formed a single read-through open reading frame (ORF). It became functionalized when a putative translocation event conferred the essential cis promoter for transcriptional initiation. We experimentally proved that all genic components of the extant gadid AFGP originated from entirely nongenic DNA. The gadid AFGP evolutionary process also represents a rare example of the proto-ORF model of de novo gene birth where a fully formed ORF existed before the regulatory element to activate transcription was acquired.},

	abstract = {Antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) are a novel evolutionary innovation in members of the northern cod fish family (Gadidae), crucial in preventing death from inoculative freezing by environmental ice in their frigid Arctic and sub-Arctic habitats. However, the genomic origin and molecular mechanism of evolution of this novel life-saving adaptive genetic trait remained to be definitively determined. To this end, we constructed large insert genomic DNA BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) libraries for two AFGP-bearing gadids, the high-Arctic polar cod Boreogadus saida and the cold-temperate Atlantic tomcod Microgadus tomcod, to isolate and sequence their AFGP genomic regions for fine resolution evolutionary analyses. The BAC library construction encountered poor cloning efficiency initially, which we resolved by pretreating the agarose-embedded erythrocyte DNA with a cationic detergent, a method that may be of general use to BAC cloning for teleost species and/or where erythrocytes are the source of input DNA. The polar cod BAC library encompassed 92,160 clones with an average insert size of 94.7 kbp, and the Atlantic tomcod library contained 73,728 clones with an average insert size of 89.6 kbp. The genome sizes of B. saida and M. tomcod were estimated by cell flow cytometry to be 836 Mbp and 645 Mbp respectively, thus their BAC libraries have approximately 10- and 9.7-fold genome coverage respectively. The inclusiveness and depth of coverage were empirically confirmed by screening the libraries with three housekeeping genes. The BAC clones that mapped to the AFGP genomic loci of the two gadids were then isolated by screening the BAC libraries with gadid AFGP gene probes. Eight minimal tiling path (MTP) clones were identified for B. saida, sequenced, and assembled. The B. saida AFGP locus reconstruction produced both haplotypes, and the locus comprises three distinct AFGP gene clusters, containing a total of 16 AFGP genes and spanning a combined distance of 512 kbp. The M. tomcod AFGP locus is much smaller at approximately 80 kbp, and contains only three AFGP genes. Fluorescent in situ hybridization with an AFGP gene probe showed the AFGP locus in both species occupies a single chromosomal location. The large AFGP locus with its high gene dosage in B. saida is consistent with its chronically freezing high Arctic habitats, while the small gene family in M. tomcod correlates with its milder habitats in lower latitudes. The results from this study provided the data for fine resolution sequence analyses that would yield insight into the molecular mechanisms and history of gadid AFGP gene evolution driven by northern hemisphere glaciation.},

	abstract = {Given the unique thermal history of the Antarctic continent, fishes of dominant suborder Notothenioidei offer a remarkable opportunity to study the physiological and biochemical characters gained and, conversely, lost during their evolutionary history and to map this information on the species phylogenetic trees. The availability of phylogenetically related notothenioid taxa living in a wide range of latitudes (in the Antarctic, sub-Antarctic and temperate regions) allows to look into the molecular bases of environmentally driven gene birth and death. This evolutionary perspective has also been supported by comparison of some features of the hemoprotein devoted to the oxygen transport in fish species living in the other polar region, the Arctic. The Arctic and Antarctic marine ichthyofaunas differ by age and isolation. Fishes of the two polar regions have undergone different regional histories which have engineered the physiological diversities, so that Antarctic fish are much more stenothermal than Arctic ones. Understanding the mechanisms of phenotypic response to cold exposure in species living at different latitudes in polar habitats offers fundamental insights into environmental adaptations. This review aims at surveying the current knowledge of molecular structure, functional features, phylogeny and adaptations of the hemoglobin of fish thriving in the Antarctic, sub-Antarctic and Arctic regions (with some excursions in the temperate latitudes). Investigating the evolutionary adaptations of hemoglobins to these environments can provide new insights into adaptation currently studied merely in temperate organisms, and can shed light into the convergent processes that evolved in response to thermal adaptations.},

We established a complete energy budget for this Arctic fish, based on laboratory measurements of consumption (C), growth (G), respiration (R), egestion (F), and excretion (U) at about 0°C. An average (N = 3) energy budget for individual juvenile Arctic cod fed live Arctic zooplankton was 100C = 50G + 24R + 9SDA + 3F + 6U + 8Z, where SDA is specific dynamic action (derived from previously published studies) and Z included activity and unaccounted energy. Eight determinations of total energy budgets for fish fed to satiation accounted for 72-104\% of the energy consumed. Maximum daily rations and growth rates were dependent on fish size and the energy content of prey. Although maximum daily rations were similar for small fish fed different prey, diets of Calanus copepods (high energy content) resulted in faster growth rates than diets of Themisto amphipods or capelin (Mallotus villosus) fillets. Both consumption and respiration rates were low at temperatures close to 0°C. The net result was slow growth rates, although the assimilation efficiency was about 80\%. Because of slow growth of individuals, the relatively high annual production of Arctic cod mainly reflects their large standing biomass.},

	abstract = {Reliable estimation of phylogeny is central to avoid inaccuracy in downstream macroevolutionary inferences. However, limitations exist in the implementation of concatenated and summary coalescent approaches, and Bayesian and full coalescent inference methods may not yet be feasible for computation of phylogeny using complicated models and large data sets. Here, we explored methodological (e.g., optimality criteria, character sampling, model selection) and biological (e.g., heterotachy, branch length heterogeneity) sources of systematic error that can result in biased or incorrect parameter estimates when reconstructing phylogeny by using the gadiform fishes as a model clade. Gadiformes include some of the most economically important fishes in the world (e.g., Cods, Hakes, and Rattails). Despite many attempts, a robust higher-level phylogenetic framework was lacking due to limited character and taxonomic sampling, particularly from several species-poor families that have been recalcitrant to phylogenetic placement. We compiled the first phylogenomic data set, including 14,208 loci (\$\&gt;\$2.8 M bp) from 58 species representing all recognized gadiform families, to infer a time-calibrated phylogeny for the group. Data were generated with a gene-capture approach targeting coding DNA sequences from single-copy protein-coding genes. Species-tree and concatenated maximum-likelihood (ML) analyses resolved all family-level relationships within Gadiformes. While there were a few differences between topologies produced by the DNA and the amino acid data sets, most of the historically unresolved relationships among gadiform lineages were consistently well resolved with high support in our analyses regardless of the methodological and biological approaches used. However, at deeper levels, we observed inconsistency in branch support estimates between bootstrap and gene and site coefficient factors (gCF, sCF). Despite numerous short internodes, all relationships received unequivocal bootstrap support while gCF and sCF had very little support, reflecting hidden conflict across loci. Most of the gene-tree and species-tree discordance in our study is a result of short divergence times, and consequent lack of informative characters at deep levels, rather than incomplete lineage sorting. We use this phylogeny to establish a new higher-level classification of Gadiformes as a way of clarifying the evolutionary diversification of the order. We recognize 17 families in five suborders: Bregmacerotoidei, Gadoidei, Ranicipitoidei, Merluccioidei, and Macrouroidei (including two subclades). A time-calibrated analysis using 15 fossil taxa suggests that Gadiformes evolved \${\textbackslash}sim \$79.5 Ma in the late Cretaceous, but that most extant lineages diverged after the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction (66 Ma). Our results reiterate the importance of examining phylogenomic analyses for evidence of systematic error that can emerge as a result of unsuitable modeling of biological factors and/or methodological issues, even when data sets are large and yield high support for phylogenetic relationships.

For example, traditional empirical database optimization techniques (e.g., cost estimation, join order selection, knob tuning, index and view selection) cannot meet the high-performance requirement for large-scale database instances, various applications and diversified users, especially on the cloud. Fortunately, learning-based techniques can alleviate this problem. On the other hand, database techniques can optimize AI models (DB4AI). For example, AI is hard to deploy in real applications, because it requires developers to write complex codes and train complicated models. Database techniques can be used to reduce the complexity of using AI models, accelerate AI algorithms and provide AI capability inside databases. Thus both DB4AI and AI4DB have been extensively studied recently. In this article, we review existing studies on AI4DB and DB4AI. For AI4DB, we review the techniques on learning-based configuration tuning, optimizer, index/view advisor, and security. For DB4AI, we review AI-oriented declarative language, AI-oriented data governance, training acceleration, and inference acceleration. Finally, we provide research challenges and future directions.},

	abstract = {The tropics contain far greater numbers of species than temperate regions, suggesting that rates of species formation might differ systematically between tropical and non-tropical areas. We tested this hypothesis by reconstructing the history of speciation in New World (NW) land birds using BAMM, a Bayesian framework for modelling complex evolutionary dynamics on phylogenetic trees. We estimated marginal distributions of present-day speciation rates for each of 2571 species of birds. The present-day rate of speciation varies approximately 30-fold across NW birds, but there is no difference in the rate distributions for tropical and temperate taxa. Using macroevolutionary cohort analysis, we demonstrate that clades with high tropical membership do not produce species more rapidly than temperate clades. For nearly any value of present-day speciation rate, there are far more species in the tropics than the temperate zone. Any effects of latitude on speciation rate are marginal in comparison to the dramatic variation in rates among clades.},
